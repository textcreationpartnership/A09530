            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN I thinke vpon the affayres, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of men, their vncertaine and ſudden chaunces and changes, truely I finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng almoſt more fraile, nothing more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, then the lyfe of man. For I perceiue howe nature hath prouided well for all other liuing creatures, by a woonderful kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, to wit, a certaine ignorance of them ſelues: but in vs only ſhe hath conuerted our memorie, vnderſtanding, prouidence, and moreouer the diuine giftes of our minde, vnto our owne toyle and deſtruction. For being alwayes ſubiect not onely vnto vayne and ſuperfluous, but alſo hurtfull and peſtiferous cares, we are both greeued with the preſent time, and alſo vexed with the time paſt, and that is to come: ſo that we ſeeme to feare nothyng ſo muche, as not to ſeeme at all tymes to be in miſerie. Our ſtudie is ſo great, whereby we heape together cauſes of miſeries, and nouryſhmentes of ſorowes, whereby we make our lyfe, whiche yf it were wel gouerned, were the moſt happie &amp; pleaſaunt thyng that we poſſeſſe, a wretched and wofull toyle, whoſe entraunce is blindneſſe, going forwarde toyle, ende ſorowe, and the whole courſe errour: Whiche he ſhall fynde to be ſo, whoſoeuer with diligent eye conſydereth the whole race of his owne lyfe. What day doo we paſſe ouer in reſt and quietneſſe? or rather doo we not finde more painefull and troubleſome then other? What mornyng haue we euer paſſed ſo merie and pleaſaunt, that hath not been ſurpriſed with ſorowe and heauineſſe before night? Of whiche euyll, although a great cauſe doo reſt in the thinges them ſelues, neuertheleſſe vnleſſe our ſelfeloue deceyue vs, a greater cauſe, or to confeſſe the trueth, the whole cauſe conſiſteth
<pb facs="tcp:14998:4"/>in our ſelues: and to let paſſe all other thinges whereby we are troubled on euery ſyde, what war, and how perpetuall is it which we maintayne agaynſt Fortune, wherein Vertue only can make vs conquerours? But willingly, &amp; wittingly we reuolt from her. We only being weaklinges &amp; vnarmed, encounter a moſt fierce foe in vnequall fight: whom ſhe againe, as lightly as thinges of nought, toſſeth vs vp, and throweth vs downe, &amp; turneth vs round about, and plaieth with vs, ſo that it were better for vs to be quite ouercome, then continually to be had in ſkorne. And what is the cauſe hereof, but only our owne lightnes &amp; daintines: for we ſeeme to be good for nothing els, but to be toſſed hither &amp; thither like a Tenniſe bal, being creatures of very ſhort life, of infinite careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp; yet ignorant vnto what ſhoare to fal with our ſhyp, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what reſolution to apply our mindes, whoſe determination is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to hang in doubt: and beſides the preſent euil, alwayes to haue ſomewhat to greeue vs behind our backe, &amp; before our eyes to make vs afeard. Which thing hapneth vnto no creature beſides man, for vnto all other it is moſt perfect ſecuritie to haue eſcaped that which is preſent. But we, in reſpect of our wit, and the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of our minde, are in continual wraſtling &amp; ſtrife with an enemie, as it were a three headed <hi>Cerberus.</hi> So that it had ben al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt better for vs to haue wanted reaſon, ſince we turne the force of our heauenly nature againſt our ſelues: for it were now an hard matter to reſiſt &amp; ſubdue this euil, being ſo deepely rooted through age &amp; cuſtome. Notwithſtanding, we muſt endeuour to doo what we may, vnto which purpoſe beſides the induſtrie of a couragious minde, to whom nothing is hard, nothing inexpugnable, it were moſt conuenient to adioyne the ſundrie ſpeeches of wyſe men, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this kinde be now alſo very rare, and eſpecially continual and diligent reading of the woorkes and monumentes of good auctours, ſo that there want not in vs a willing minde to conſent vnto their holſome inſtructions, which I may boldly tearme in earth to be the only &amp; liuely fountaine of good and fruitfull aduice. Wherfore, ſince we know that meane writers ſomtime are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for their bare affection, or for that they haue ſeemed to haue broken the Ice vnto thoſe that haue followed them: howe greatly are we beholden vnto the great and famous writers, who
<pb facs="tcp:14998:4"/>being conuerſant many hundred yeeres before vs here vpon the earth, in their diuine wittes, and moſt godly ordinances, doo yet lyue, dwel, and talke with vs? And among the perpetuall ſurges of our mindes, like ſo many bright ſhining Starres fixed in the firmament of Trueth, like ſo many ſweete and pleaſant gales of winde, like ſo many induſtrious and expert ſaylers, do both point vs to the hauen, and direct the flittering ſayles of our barkes thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and guyde the ſterne of our flitting minde, vntyll ſuch tyme as our conſultations, which haue ben toſt and driuen to and fro by tempeſtes, doo ſtay their courſe, and qualifie their motions. And this is the true Philoſophie, not which is lifted vp with deceipt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full winges, and vainely caſteth about, moſt proudly boaſting it ſelfe in vnprofitable diſputations, but that by aſſured and modeſt degrees leadeth the redieſt way vnto ſafetie. To exhort thee vnto this ſtudie perhaps it were freendly done, but truely it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie: For Fortune hath made thee greedie to reade much, and to knowe many thynges, who, as they ſay, beareth a great ſtroke in the worlde, expoſing thee to be toſſed in the troubleſome and deepe ſea of cares and troubles. Howbeit, as ſhe hath taken from thee the leaſure to reade, ſo hath ſhe not the deſire to knowe, but that beyng delighted alwayes in the frendſhyppe and familiaritie of learned men, and vpon the moſt buſieſt dayes, as often as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie ſhall ſerue to ſteale idle houres, thou myghteſt haue a wyll to be euery day better inſtructed, and learned in moſt excellent matters: wherein I am a witneſſe that thou haſt often vſed thy memorie, wherein thou art inferiour to none, in ſteede of bookes. Wherevnto yf thou were prone enough in thyne youth, thou art nowe to be deemed ſo muche the more proner: as the wayfaryng man that ſettech foorth late, may ſeeme to be freſher and redier to trauayle, then he that ſet foorth in the mornyng, foraſmuche as this is a common complaint among them, that the way waxeth longer, and the day decreaſeth: the whiche thing hapneth vnto vs in this courſe of our lyfe, whileſt we trauayle towardes the euenyng, and ſee that we haue yet a long way to walke. I neede not therefore to exhorte thee to doo that, whiche thou haſt alwayes

For we wage double war with Fortune, and in both there is in a manner equal danger: wherof there is but one part co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> name, to wit, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is called Aduerſitie. The Philoſophers although they knew both, yet they iudged this to be the harder. And therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaying of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his boke of Ethikes is receiued as true, wherein he thus defineth, concerning this matter: ſaying, <hi>That it is an harder matter to endure aduerſitie, then to abſtaine from pleaſures.</hi> Whom <hi>Seneca</hi> following, and writing to <hi>Lucillus: <hi>It is a greater matter,</hi>
                  </hi> ſayth he, <hi>to paſse ouer difficult matters, then to moderate the proſperous.</hi> What ſhall I ſay? May I preſume to gaggle among ſuch woorthie men?

                  </gap>h olde matters. And therfore on the one ſide I am moued by auctoritie, on the other by antiquitie. But there commeth vnto my mind, the auctoritie of an other great &amp; auncient man: For it cannot be otherwiſe, but that euery man conceiue an opinion of a thing, according as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vnto him. They are the woordes of <hi>Marcus Brutus,</hi> writing vnto <hi>Atticus,</hi> which I ſuppoſe to be ſo true, that nothyng can be more true. <hi>For what can I iudge of any thyng, otherwyſe then I thynke? vnleſſe perhappes I be conſtrayned to iudge by other mennes iudgementes, whiche who ſo dooeth, he iudgeth not of hym ſelfe, but reporteth the iudgementes of other.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14998:5"/>I therefore thus with reuerence paſſing ouer the iudgementes of ſuche notable men, beyng in ſuche manner affectioned, if I woulde ſay any thyng concernyng myne owne iudgement, I knowe wel that ſome haue diuerſly diſputed otherwyſe of the vertues, and that the preheminence is not alwayes geuen to the moſt difficult, neyther that it hapned by chaunce that modeſtie, or whether thou had rather cal it temperance, poſſeſſed the laſt place. But as touchyng our purpoſe whereof we entreate, I ſuppoſe it an harder matter to gouerne proſperitie, then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie: and I playnely profeſſe, that in mine opinion, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in mine experience, flatteryng fortune is more to be feared, and farre more perilous, then threatnyng fortune: vnto whiche opinion, it is not the fame of writers, nor the ſubtiltie of woords, nor the falſe ſillogiſmes of ſophiſters, but true experience it ſelfe, and the dayly examples of this lyfe, and the ſcarcitie, whiche is a great argument of the difficultie, whiche enforceth me. For why? I haue ſeene many that haue indifferently ſuſteyned loſſes, pouertie, exile, impriſonment, punyſhment, death, and great ſickeneſſes that are more greeuous then death: but that could wel beare ryches, honoures, and power, I neuer yet ſawe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. For oftentymes, euen in my ſight, thoſe that haue ſtoode inuincible agaynſt al violence of aduerſe fortune, proſperous fortune hath ouerthrowen with ſmal force, and her flatteries haue ouercome that valiencie of mans minde, whiche her threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynges could not ſubdue. It commeth to paſſe, I wot not how, that ſo ſoone as fortune waxeth more milde, the ſoftned mindes of men beginne lykewyſe to growe proud, and by enioying proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie, to conceyue forgetfulneſſe of their owne condition. Neyther is it ſpoken without cauſe, and vſed nowe among our countrey men as a prouerbe, that it is an harde matter to beare proſperitie. Neyther was it ſpoken by <hi>Horace</hi> vnaduiſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Learne to beare wel good fortune:</hi> For he iudged it to be an hard matter, and not knowen without diligent ſtudie. But <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> very breefely diſcourſed of that part of fortune, which ſeemed vnto hym to be moſt difficult, and is doubtleſſe at the firſt ſight the more rough and hard of the twayne. Whiche booke is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly abrode in mens handes, whereunto it is not my meaning
<pb facs="tcp:14998:6"/>to adde or detract any thyng at al, both for that the woorke, being wrytten by ſo great a wit, diſdayneth to come vnder our cenſure, &amp; alſo being buſied about mine owne affayres, am not purpoſed to correcte or carpe other mens doinges. But foraſmuche as Vertue and Trueth are publique thinges, there is no reaſon that the ſtudie of antiquitie ſhoulde be any hindrance to the induſtrie of poſteritie, for whoſe cauſe we knowe that it was vndertaken, to the ende we ſhould thereby be ſtyrred vp and holpen. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I purpoſe to entreate with thee ſomewhat concernyng the ſame matter, that that whiche he dyd then for his freende <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,</hi> I may nowe do in lyke ſort for my freende <hi>Azo,</hi> whiche I am determined ſo farre foorth to accompliſhe, as ſhal lye in this my buſied and werie wyt to do: and ouer and beſides alſo, to touche the other part, whiche eyther of forgetfulneſſe or purpoſe was by hym pretermitted. I haue moreouer of ſet purpoſe mingled a fewe matters, not touchyng the defectes of any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, but the excellencie of vertues or vices: whiche although they be beſides the purpoſe, yet are not vnlyke in effect, &amp; ſeeme to be ſuche as are able to make mens mindes glad or ſorowfull. Wherein how I haue behaued my ſelfe, thou ſhalt be iudge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mindeful of my buſineſſe and the ſhortneſſe of the tyme, who with great admiration ſaweſt the whole woorke begunne and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in a very fewe dayes, I only am iudge of the credite. I haue endeuoured not to ſet downe whatſoeuer ſeemed beſt lykyng to my ſelfe, but that myght be moſt profitable vnto thee and others, whoſoeuer els haply hath touched the ſame. To be ſhort, the ende whiche I alwayes propoſed to my ſelfe in this kynde of ſtudie, was not ſo muche the commendation of the wryter, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of the reader, yf ſo be there may be any hoped for or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by me, hauing a ſpeciall reſpect hereunto, that it ſhould not be needeful for thee to toſſe and turne ouer thy whole armorie at euery alarme and doubt of the enemie: but rather to the entent thou myghteſt haue in a redineſſe agaynſt euer miſcheefe, and hurtful good, &amp; eyther fortune, a ſhort medicine, but freendly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected for a double diſeaſe: ſo that thou mayeſt alwayes haue at hande, as they ſay, in al places, &amp; at al times, as it were, an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al remedie conteyned in a litle boxe. For as I haue ſaid, both For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
<pb facs="tcp:14998:6"/>faces are to be feared, but notwithſtandyng both muſt be endured, whereof the one hath neede of a bridle, the other of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: in the one, the pride of the minde of men is to be repreſſed: in the other, their werineſſe and greefe to be ſuccoured and relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Wherefore, when I thought vpon this varietie, and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with my ſelfe to wryte ſomewhat concernyng this argument, not only thou cameſt into my minde woorthie of that gyft, which both of vs may vſe indifferently, as ſayeth <hi>Cicero,</hi> but alonely moouedſt me to wryte it, not onely in woordes, as beyng priuie of al mine enterpriſes whatſoeuer, but alſo in deedes, being of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For we knowe how that Fortune hath tormented many vpon the racke, &amp; many ſhe hath lulled aſleepe in delites, and many ſhe hath ſwinged vp &amp; downe in her wheele: neyther want we examples of ſuch as clymbe, nor of ſome that fal, neyther am I ignorant that ſome haue been throwen downe from the top of high dignitie. Howe many Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours of <hi>Rome,</hi> how many forren Princes, being plucked out of their regal thrones, eyther by their owne handes, or the handes of their enimies, haue been depriued both of their lyues &amp; Empires at one inſtant? Shal we borowe al our examples of antiquitie, ſince we our ſelues haue ſeene of late dayes ſome kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges taken priſoners, and ſome ſlaine in battayl, and ſome behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at home, and (which is moſt extreame of al) ſome hanged by the necke, &amp; ſome moſt ſhamefully mangled in peeces? Thou art one vnto whom Nature hath geuen a princely hart, but Fortune hath not geuen a kyngdome, nor yet taken it away: yet whom in other reſpectes ſhe hath more diuerſly toſſed and turmoyled, I ſuppoſe there is none to be found in our age. For being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme in excellent good health, and enioying very great ſtrength of body, it is ſtrange to recount howe not many yeeres ſince, to the great wonder of al that know thee, being thrice geuen ouer by the Phiſitions, thrice thou repoſedſt thy life &amp; ſafetie in the onely helpe of the heauenly Phiſition, &amp; at the length waſt by hym re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to thy former health, but in ſuch wiſe, that thou haſt vtterly loſt thine accuſtomed ſtrength of body, with no leſſe wonder of thy excellent dexteritie, &amp; rare grauitie: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou who before time had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt moſt ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g &amp; valiant legges, &amp; feete almoſt as hard as braſſe.

Thy countrey al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at one tyme ſawe thee both a lord, and a banyſhed man: but ſo notwithſtandyng, that thou ſeemedſt to be nothyng at all blemiſhed by thy baniſhment. There was neuer any almoſt of our countreymen, that ſtoode in lyke fauour of noble men and princes, and neuer any that ſuſteyned lyke iniurie. And whereas not long before they ſtriued in ſhewyng thee tokens of curteſie, afterward the ſame men conſented in nothyng ſo muche, as in conſpyring and laying their heades together howe to procure thy deſtruction. Of whom ſome ſought meanes to take away thy lyfe, who before tyme had honoured thee the ſpace of many yeeres with golde and precious ſtones, and many other large giftes, duryng the tyme of thy proſperous and fauourable for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and, whiche is moſt greeuous of al, to ſpoyle thee of thy freendes and clientes, and thy whole familie, by afflictyng them with ſundry greeuous tormentes, and ſtrange kyndes of death. But ſuch as were of the more curteous ſort, inuaded thy great patrimony, thy landes, thy people, thy houſes, thy townes: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they that ſawe thee not long before, and perceyued how ſuddeinely thou waſt fallen from great wealth into extreame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, wondred as it had been at ſome ſtrange miracle of fortune. Some of thy freendes, as I haue ſaid, are periſhed, &amp; in thoſe that remaine, their faith is decaied, &amp; the goodwil of men, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon maner is, flyeth away with proſperitie: ſo that thou art brought into a doubt which to bewaile firſt, either the death of thy freends that are peryſhed, or the loſſe of their aſſuredneſſe that are liuing. Now in the middeſt of theſe troubles there happened vnto thee a moſt deſperate and dangerous ſickeneſſe, wherein thou waſt brought ſo neare vnto death, that when euery man ſuppoſed thou couldeſt not eſcape, it was generally reported that thou waſt dead. Which ſickeneſſe, which pouertie, which heape of troubles, in that thou waſt driuen out of thine owne countrey, and farre from thine owne houſe in a ſtrange lande, and warre rounde about thee, and thou on euerye ſyde oppreſſed, gaue occaſyon that in the meane whyle thou couldeſt haue no enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,

There was no extremitie wantyng, ſauing impriſonment, and death: although we cannot ſay neyther, that thou waſt quite free from impriſonment, whileſt thy moſt faythful wyfe, and al thy ſonnes, beyng part of thy bowelles, and thy daughters al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo were taken priſoners by thine enimies, and there was no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort remayning vnto thee of ſo many chyldren: N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To be ſhorte, we haue ſeene that ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in thee, whiche we reade of two moſt excellent perſonagies, <hi>Caius Marius,</hi> and the great <hi>Pompeius,</hi> to wit, that fortune hath ſeuerally expreſſed in thee, and thy chyldren, what good and euyl ſhe is able to do, and neuer mingle any proſperttie with aduerſitie: whoſe flatteries in tymes paſt, although theu haſt not caſted ſo plentifully as many happie men haue done, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandyng thou haſt abidden her threates and force of late dayes, with ſo couragious and inuincible a mynde, that in this reſpect thou haſt geuen occaſion vnto many, who before hated thy name, to loue thee, and woonder at thee. For vertue hath this proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that it ſtirreth vp good men to loue it, and aſtunniſheth the euyl. Whiche propertie as it is common to euery vertue, ſo is it peculier eſpecially to fortitude, whoſe tranquilitie and vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is the more acceptable, and lyght more conſpicable among the troubleſome turmoyles of fortune, and darkeneſſe of terrible thinges. For vnto me thou haſt not onely heaped vp much new good wyl, vpon the auntient loue whiche I bare towardes thee, whiche I thought to haue been impoſſible, but haſt alſo conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my quill, whiche made haſt towardes another matter, to wryte this woorke in tyme not purpoſed, both that thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt beholde the countenance of thy mynde in my wrytinges, as it were in a lookyng glaſſe: and alſo if herein there were any thyng that ſeemed vnto thee nothyng fine, but rather rude and barbarous, and whiche in deede dyd not lyke thee, that in this manner thou order and take it: that yf it ſhal chaunce that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hereafter varrie with thee in any ſtrange manner or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,

Notwithſtandyng I knowe wel enough, that as the diſeaſes of the minde are inuiſible, ſo are there remedies inuiſible alſo: For they that are ſeduced by falſe opinions, muſt be remedied by true perſwaſions, that they that fel by hearyng, may alſo ryſe by hearyng. Moreouer, who ſo wyllingly offereth vnto his freende, beyng in neede, that whiche he hath to releeue hym withal, howe ſmal ſoeuer it be, he hath fulfilled the duetie of perfect freendſhyp. For freendſhyp weigheth the mynde, and not the thing, whiche though it be but ſmal, yet may it be an argument of great good wyl. For my part, as I wyſhe vnto thee al honour, ſo haue I nothyng at this preſent more conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to geue thee: whiche yf thou thinke to be of any force, the commoditie of it, whiche maketh euery thyng to be regarded, ſhal ſufficiently commend it.

And, <hi>O that this ſwiftneſſe of tyme, and ſhortneſſe of lyfe were as well knowen in the beginning, as it is in the ende?</hi> whiche to thoſe that enter ſeemeth infinite, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng when they goe out, and are ſcarce ſo many minutes as they appeared to be hundredes of yeeres. So then, at length de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceypt is knowen when it can not be auoyded: whereby it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that many tymes counſell is geuen in vayne vnto thoſe yeeres, they are both vnbeleeuyng, and vnſkylfull, diſdainefull of anothers counſell, and wantyng of their owne. And therefore, there is nothyng that diſcouereth the errours of youth, although they be innumerable and greeuous, and yet notwithſtandyng hyd and vnknowen to thoſe that committed them, better then olde age doth, and layeth them foorth before their eyes, who ſometyme diſſembled them, and winked at them. Neither doo ye ſooner perceyue what ye ought to be, then ye be made that whiche ye woulde be, and then ye can poſſibly be none other then ye be. But yf there were any that coulde vnderſtande theſe thynges in tyme, or by hym ſelfe, or beleeue when he is taught, ſurely hym woulde I accompt a woorthy and happie youth among many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandes, he ſhoulde not paſſe his lyfe through ſo many difficulties, whoſe onely courſe lyeth ſafe and ſtraight through vertue.</p>

Accidentes may periſhe, the ſubiect remaynyng, but when the body periſheth, they muſt needes decay. And among all the qualities whiche paſſe away with this mortall body, there is none ſwyfter then beautie, whiche ſo ſoone as euer it hath ſhewed it ſelfe as a pleaſant flowre, it vaniſheth euen in the ſight of them that woonder at it and prayſe it: it is quickely nipt with the leaſt froſt, and beaten downe with a ſmal winde, and eyther ſuddenly pinched of with the nayle of ſome enimies hande, or ouerthrowen with the heele of ſome ſickneſſe paſſing by.

For no man can be a true oratour, that is to ſay, a maiſter of eloquence, vnleſſe he be a good man And if thou, beeing a good and a wiſe man, diddeſt ſuppoſe that this ſtreame and readineſſe of woordes, which for the moſt part doth moſt abounde in the fancie and impudent crue, was ſufficient for the commendation of the Oratorie, and the perfect duety of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, or that this cunning in ſpeache only was yenough, thou waſt deceiued. The redines of the tongue, &amp; plentie of wordes, &amp; the art and ſkil alſo to vſe them, may be indifferent to the wicked and the godly: but that which thou ſeekeſt apparteineth to the beſt ſort of men, &amp; not to al of them, but to very few: ſo that euill men are baniſhed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation, being a thing wherunto the good gifts of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> minde, as vertue &amp; wiſdome, are required, whiche they do want. Which, if thou do not vnderſtand to be ſo, I wyll
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14998:17"/>ſhewe thee howe. And remember theſe two thinges whereof I ſpeake, &amp; imprint their diffinitions in thy minde, whereof the one is <hi>Catoes,</hi> the other <hi>Ciceroes.</hi> The fyrſt ſayth thus: <hi>An Oratour is an honeſt man, ſkilful in ſpeaking.</hi> The other: <hi>Eloquence,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>is nothyng els but wiſedome, ſpeaking copiouſly.</hi> By theſe woordes thou ſeeſt, that to the eſſence and ſubſtaunce of an Oratour, and of Eloquence, is honeſtie and wyſedome required, whiche notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding are not ſufficient, vnleſſe there be cunning, &amp; copie. So that the two firſt thinges do make a man good and wiſe only, the other make hym neither good nor wiſe, nor eloquent, but full of woordes. Al theſe ioyned togeather, do make a perfect Oratour, and his cunning which truely is a more rare and high thing, then they ſuppoſe that hope that it conſiſteth in multitude of woordes. And therefore if thou couet the name of an Oratour, and ſeeke for the true prayſe of Eloquence: fyrſt ſtudie vertue and wyſedome.</p>

                  <p>It ſkilleth much by what nobilitie. For, a countrey is made noble by the number of inhabitauntes, by the aboundaunce of rycheſſe, by the fertilitie
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14998:24"/>of the ſoyle, and the commoditie of ſituation, holſome ayre, cleere ſprynges, the ſea nygh, ſafe hauens, conuenient riuers. A noble countrey is commonly called ſuche an one as is fruitful of Wyne &amp; other commodities, as corne, cattayle, flockes of ſheepe, heardes of rudder beaſtes, mynes of golde and ſiluer. Ye cal that a good countrey wherein are bread ſtrong Horſes, fat Oxen, tender Ryddes, and pleaſant fruites. But where good men are bred, ye neyther enquyre after, neyther thynke it woorth the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiryng, ſo excellent iudges of matters ye be. Howbeit, only the vertue of the inhabitauntes is the chiefe commendation of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.

                  <p>It hath then it owne peculyar commendation, and it taketh part alſo of thyne: What ſo euer thou dooeſt wel, the chiefe prayſe thereof redowneth in a maner to thy countrey. There was one that went about to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> glory vnto the citie of <hi>Athens,</hi> who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered very grauely, and as it became ſuche a man to doo: For when a certayne felowe called <hi>Seriphius,</hi> an inhabitour of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne ſmal and obſcure Ilande, in heat of wordes, obiected hym in the teeth, that it was his countreys glory, and not his owne, that made hym famous: Veryly anſwered he, neyther ſhoulde I be obſcure if I were <hi>Seriphius,</hi> neyther thou be renowmed yf thou were an <hi>Athenian.</hi> He truſted not to the glory of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, but to the glory of his owne vertue: muche more manlyke then <hi>Plato,</hi> although he were the greater Philoſopher. Howbeit ſometymes in great wits, there be great and wonderful errours: He therefore among other thinges aſcribeth the renowme of his countrey to his felicitie. And that thou mayeſt knowe the whole mynd of this moſt excellent man in this reſpect, <hi>Plato</hi> ſayd that he gaue thankes for many thynges. Truely this was wel ſayde, if ſo be that he vnderſtood to whom, and for what gyftes he ſhould geue thankes. He gaue thankes to nature. Firſt, for making hym a man, and not a dumbe beaſt, of the male kind, &amp; not a woman, a <hi>Greeke,</hi> &amp; not a <hi>Barbarian,</hi> an <hi>Athenian,</hi> &amp; not a <hi>Thebane,</hi> &amp; laſtly, that he was borne in the tyme of <hi>Socratis,</hi> &amp; not at any other, to the ende he might be taught &amp; inſtructed by hym. Thus thou ſeeſt, how among his cauſes of gratulation and glorying, he putteth in alſo that he was borne in <hi>Athens.</hi> What I wil ſay herein, perhaps thou attendeſt. Although our talke be begun con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng this poynt onely, notwithſtandyng foraſmuch as it hath chaunced vs to make mention of ſo excellent a man, I wil declare what other men, and what I my ſelfe alſo, do thinke of this his whole talke. I know that there be ſome famous &amp; eloquent men, which do boldly affirme, that there was neuer any thing ſpoken by any man more fooliſhly: vnto whoſe opinion there lacketh li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle but I do agree. For, I pray you, to what purpoſe is it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in theſe thynges: what if he had ben borne a <hi>Barbarian,</hi> or
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14998:25"/>made a woman? Haue there not ben many <hi>Barbarians,</hi> that haue excelled many <hi>Grecians,</hi> both in vertue and wit? Are there not ſome women, that both in glory of many thinges, &amp; inuention of Artes, are more commendable than certayne men? To be ſhort, what if he had been borne an Oxe or an Aſſe, what ſhould that haue belonged to <hi>Plato</hi> of whom we ſpeake? who then ſhould not haue been <hi>Plato,</hi> but that thing rather which dame nature had framed him. Vnleſſe perhappes he gaue credite to the madnes of <hi>Pithagoras,</hi> to wit, that ſoules paſſed out of one body into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: whiche opinion is ſo fonde, that truely there was neuer any thing ſpoken more foolyſhly or more impudently, I ſay not by a Philoſopher, but by a man nothing more diſſonant to the trueth and godlynes, or that religious eares doo more abhorre. Farther then, What, was it ſo noble a matter to be borne at <hi>Athens,</hi> that it coulde not be ſo good to be borne elſwhere, no not at <hi>Thebes?</hi> Were not <hi>Homer,</hi> and <hi>Pythogoras</hi> him ſelfe, and <hi>Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> and <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and thouſands other, borne eſwhere then at <hi>Athens,</hi> and as highly eſteemed, as they that were borne there? And that I may not now depart from <hi>Thebes,</hi> which the Grecians are vſed to diſpiſe: If ye ſeeke for a wit, was not the Poet <hi>Pindarus</hi> borne there? who as <hi>Horace</hi> ſayth, <hi>Can not poſsibly be matched by imitation?</hi> If ye require renowme of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent deedes, <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and <hi>Hercules,</hi> were ſo famous, that <hi>Alexa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if ye looke for both theſe in one, is there not freſh in memorie, and as it were before your eyes, <hi>Epaminundas</hi> of <hi>Thebes,</hi> an excellent Philoſopher, and a moſt valiaunt Captaine, and in the vpright iudgement of all men, prince and chiefe of the <hi>Grecians</hi> in al ages? The ſame is he that almoſt vtterly ſubuerted the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and put <hi>Platoes</hi> cuntreymen the <hi>Athenians</hi> in ſuche feare, that when he was dead, beyng delyuered of a great terrour, immediatly they gaue them ſelues vp to licentiouſneſſe and flouth: And whyle he floo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſhed at <hi>Thebes,</hi> howe many thouſandes of idle perſons and fooles lyued at <hi>Athens,</hi> who is able eaſily to recount in his mynde? He ought therefore to haue geuen thankes, not for that
<pb facs="tcp:14998:26"/>he was borne at <hi>Athens,</hi> but for that he was borne ſuche an one, that is to ſay, with ſuche a witte, and ſuche a mynde, and finally in ſuche good lykyng of his parentes, and in ſuche plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of temporall goodes, that he myght be ſet to ſchoole and inſtructed in all goodnes: For theſe thynges, I ſay, it was behouefull for ſo learned a man, ſo zelouſly to haue geuen thankes vnto that GOD, whiche had beſtowed them vppon hym: not for <hi>Socrates,</hi> nor for <hi>Athens,</hi> in whoſe ſchoole, and in whiche citie howe many vniuſt and vnlearned perſons there were, it is an eaſier matter to geſſe, then to knowe. But to ſpeake no more of the citie: In that ſchoole among many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were <hi>Alcibiades</hi> and <hi>Critias,</hi> the one an emmie to his countrey, the other a moſt cruell tyrant: to whom howe muche theyr maiſter <hi>Socrates</hi> auayled, let <hi>Plato</hi> hym ſelfe aunſweare mee, or thereby let hym vnderſtande howe vayne a thyng it is whiche the doctrine of an earthly ſchoolemaiſter ſoundeth in the eares of his ſchollars, vnleſſe the grace of the heauenly Maiſter be inſpired withall into them, without whiche, <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> coulde doo nothyng: although, as we haue ſayde before, he was iudged to be the wyſeſt man by the oracle of a lyuyng God. But notwithſtandyng, let hym excuſe hym ſelfe, or ſome other man for hym, what euer he be, of his moſt foolyſhe conuerſation with his two wiues, moſt tatter and teſtie olde women. But this and the reſidue, we haue ſpoken, as it were by the way, except this one thing only, whereby thou ſhouldeſt vnderſtand, that <hi>Plato</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo great a man as he was, notwithſtanding was led with the vanitie of his gloryous countrey: Not to this ende, that thou ſhouldeſt couer thyne errour, with the buckler of ſo great a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, but that thou mighteſt more diligently eſchewe him, vnto whoſe example and aucthoritie thou ſeeſt that great wittes haue yeelded.</p>

                  <p>Good fare apperteineth to pleaſure, but feaſtes to madneſſe. For what is it other than pompous frenſie, to cal togeather a great many ryche folkes into one place, from theyr honeſt buſines, and to entertayne them with honourable weerineſſe, and to glut a number of bellies with delicate and hurtful meates, for whom it had been better to haue been emptie, or to haue been filled at theyr owne diſcretion? wherein as perhaps thou ſhalt pleaſe one mans mouth, ſo ſhalt thou diſpleaſe the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of many. For it is ſeldome ſeene that gheſtes agree in diet, and that is found to be true which the Poete ſayth: <hi>I haue three gheſtes which ſeme vnto me almoſt to diſagre, requyring diuers meat, with a greatly differing appetite, what I geue, what I geue not, what
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:14998:32"/>geueſt thou, <hi>Flaccus,</hi> or what dooeſt thou? Vnleſſe a man would geue them nothyng at all, and leaue this care to them who haue no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter care. Let them doo what they lyſt, which can doo nothyng els. Now if three doo diſagree, what wyl an hundred, or a thouſand doo?</hi> They wyl ſcarce depart, at leaſt wyſe, without ſecrete murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng. This had an yll taſte. That had an il ſmell. The other ſhould haue been ſet downe firſt. This came colde to the boarde. That came out of ſeaſon. The other dyſhe was ſet downe with a ſorowful countenaunce. This with an angrie looke. That meate was rawe. The other torne. One wayter was to ſlowe. This to haſtie. That felowe coulde not heare. The other was ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne. One was to loude: Another to ſylent. This ſeruant brought warme water to the table with vnwaſhed handes: An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other fylled ſmall wyne to the boorde. With theſe and ſuche lyke complayntes, not only the Halles, but the wayes doo reſounde, and the ſtreetes alſo, and not without cauſe. For to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is it, ſo gently to ſolicite men with entreatie to dyne at thy houſe? to what ende ſerueth that vnprofitable coſt, and ſuperftu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous labour, and to bryng ſo great a troupe into one court, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to boaſt thy ſelfe among thy neyghbours, and as it were thy ſelfe beyng on foote, to make a voluptuous triumphe of thy ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quettes? The trumpets alſo and ſhaknes ſounde foorth togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that it appeareth that al thyngs are prepared for pompe, and nothyng for thriftineſſe. Imagine, that the next day after, one of the gheſtes ſtoode in neede of ſo muche as the dyſhe of meate was woorth which he ate: he ſhal neuer be able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne it of the maiſter of the feaſt. For the feaſt was not made for the gheſt, but for hymſelfe: Whiche although vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly it be ſo, notwithſtandyng when drunken men ſytte at the Table ſwearyng and affyrmyng any thyng vpon theyr othe, they ſtrike the meate, ſaying theſe woordes: I ſweare, ſay they, by this our good loue and charitie whiche nowe we exerciſe togeather. To whom it may be well anſwered: Nay rather, ſweare by this your drunkenneſſe and ſurfet. This were true charitie, yf beyng faſtyng and drie, you would conuert that to the vſe of the poore, whiche now ye lauiſh out to your owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, then might ye not improperly ſweare by your charitie.
<pb facs="tcp:14998:33"/>Ye byd vnto your feaſtes the proude ryche men, and ye ſhut out the poore hungrie ſort, thynkyng it a glorious matter to haue plentie of woorſhypful gheaſtes. And in this point, beſydes the opinion of the common people, whiche is the fountayne of all errour, ye haue an aucthour: <hi>Beleeue me</hi> ſayth <hi>Cicero, <hi>it is ae ſeemely thyng for the houſes of worſhipfulmen, to be open vnto wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipful gheſtes.</hi>
                     </hi> In deede ſyr, this is very good, for them to be open to choſe that can requite with the lyke, but to be ſhut agaynſt the needie.

But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne agayne to the matter, yf thou wylt be without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playntes and diſdayne of gheſtes, abſteyne from feaſtes: They that haue ben preſent at a feaſt, haue had ſome iuſt cauſe perhaps to reprooue ſomewhat, and to be greeued: but he that is offended becauſe he was not at the feaſt, he is no gheſt, but a moſt impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Paraſite, whoſe tongue is no more to be eſteemed then his belly, whiche is not only not to be feared, but many tymes to be wyſhed: for as the Satiricall Poet ſayth, <hi>what commedie can there be better, or what more pleaſaunt Ieſter, then an hungrie ſtomacke?</hi> Some ſuch are deſcribed by the Comic writers, &amp; diuerſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke laughter: what could they do, vnleſſe they were hearde in preſence?

                  <p>A great price for moſt vile ware, to become a Cooke to pleaſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens belyes. I ſuppoſe there be ſome whom their ſtomackes doo pinche, and pouertie dooeth brydle, vnto whom nothyng is more acceptable, then to be diſcharged of that brydle by the care and charge of other, and to obteine that by other mens meanes, whiche by their owne they are not able. Thoſe that yeelde them this ſupplie, ſo long they extol and magnifie, as they doo ſo: But if once they leaue of, they themſelues alſo ſhall ſurceaſe to be lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger extolled: and thus wyll I alſo ſurceaſe, and this is the ſumme of all. The condition of gheſtes, is to be delicate, and complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and very hard to pleaſe. And concernyng <hi>Paraſites,</hi> learne this ſhort rule: Whyle thou feedeſt them abundantly, they wyll eate, and laugh with thee, they wyll clappe their handes, they wyl commende thee to be a good man, liberall, and call thee a notable member of thy common wealth: They wyl leaue out no one iote of perfect Grecian adulation, whereof the <hi>Satyrical</hi> poet ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng, tearmeth it a nation moſt expert in flatterie, and a great deuourer of meate, with other ſuche qualities commonly knowen to boyes. If thou leaue of ſometyme thy liberalitie, they wyll dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame thee to be couetous, wretched, and miſerable. But yf thou do it through want, then they wyl report of thee, that truly thou art a poore man, but there is no harme in thee, ſauing that thou art a foole, and haſt no wit, and they wyl ſhunne thee and thy houſe, as it were a rocke. Then ſhalt thou perceyue that ſaying of <hi>Horace</hi> to be true: <hi>The friendes depart, when once the lees waxe drie in the caſke:</hi> where the Poet ſpeaketh of ſuche kynde of freendes. As for true freendes, they ſpecially continue in aduerſitie, and moſt diligently frequent thoſe houſes whiche fortune hath forſaken. Suche follies and difficulties it were beſt to redreſſe in tyme, and to learne to contemne theſe proude gheſtes, theſe dry ſcoffers, with their bablyng and tittletattle, and perſwade thy ſelfe thus: There is no place for vpright iudgement, where al thing is attributed to pleaſure, and nothing to vertue. Finally, this tranſitorie name which is purchaſed by euyll meanes, and this which is commonly called glorie, among learned men is counted infamie, not glorie.</p>

And thou perhaps being another mans ſeruant, doeſt weerie nations that are a great way of from thee. For thee the Fleminges ſpinne, for thee they carde, for thee they weaue: for thee the Perſians, the Seres, the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans do ioyle: for thee the Tyrian Murrey ſwimmeth, or Purple fiſhe: for thee the ſofte grains of <hi>Hiſpis</hi> hangeth vpon the ſhrubs: for thee the ſheepe of Brytaine looke whyte: for thee the Indian <hi>Sandix</hi> looketh redde: both Oceans ſweate for thy ſake: but for <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> only his wife and his daughter, his ſiſter and his nices do take payne.

This I confeſſe, is a good and true diuiſion, for it equally deuideth tyme into the partes: But if it be thus taken, that the partes be of equal ſpace, truely there is an other great difference betweene them. For there is no cogitation or diſcourſe more ſharpe, or more deepe, then the nyghtly, no tyme more conuenient for ſtudentes. If he ſay that ſleepe is the one halfe of our tyme, it is a ſtrange ſaying, to come out of the mouth of ſo ſtudious and learned a man. God forbyd that a minde whiche is well inſtructed, and geuen to ſtudie, ſhoulde ſleepe halfe her tyme, ſeeyng to ſome the fourth part, and to voluptuous perſons alſo the thyrde part is ſufficient. I would counſell a man to ryſe in the nyght, in euery part of the yeere. God forbyd, but that they which haue any great exployt in hande, ſleepe both the whole Winter and Summer nyghtes: Howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, it is ſufficient perhappes to haue broken it once, and as muche ſleepe as is broken by watching, ſo muche may be quickly ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yf neede ſo require, by takyng a nappe after noone. But the houres of the winter nyghters are often to be broken: in them it were expedient to ſyng, to ſtudie, to reade, to write, to thynke, to contemplate, by wit ſome new thing is to be deuiſed, &amp; that which is wonne by ſtudie, is to be repeated in memorie. Hearken alſo to <hi>S. Ierome,</hi> wryting to <hi>Euſtochius: <hi>We muſt ryſe,</hi>
                     </hi> ſayth he, <hi>twice or thrice a nyght, and we muſt meditate on ſome part of Scripture whiche we haue learned without booke: And at length, when your eyes are weerie with this ſtudie, ye muſt eftſoones refreſhe them with ſleepe, and beyng then recomforted with a lytle reſt, they muſt agayne be weeried with exerciſe, leſt that by ſleeping all the night long, and lying ſtyl vpon the pillowe, ye appeare to be as it were buried carkaſes: By the often and coomely ſtyrring of your ſelues, declare that ye are alyue, and geuen to vertue.</hi>

                  <p>Straunge odours, and the art of perfumyng, and pleaſauntly ſmellyng, is an argument of no natural good ſmel, and a token of ſome ſecrete defectes.

                  <p>This hath been a pleaſure vnto many heretofore, and now it is to thee. For in olde tyme, who ſo coulde not ſyng and play vpon inſtrumentes, was counted vnlearned, which iudgement fel vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> the Athenian, the moſt noble of all the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, for that he refuſed to play vppon an Harpe as he ſate with company at meate. And <hi>Cicero</hi> reporteth, that <hi>Fpaminundas</hi> the Thebane, perhaps becauſe he woulde auoyde that ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, could play very excellently vppon inſtrumentes. It is ſtraunge, that <hi>Socrates</hi> beyng ſo graue a Father as he was, would learne to play: and therfore let vs not maruayle though <hi>Alcibiadis</hi> were by his vncle <hi>Periclis</hi> ſet to ſchole to learne vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Recorder, beyng among them ſo commendable an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, that they learned the ſame alſo among the lyberal artes.

This ardent deſyre of Muſicke, although it be not

For <hi>Caius</hi> the Emperour, was very muche geuen to ſyngyng and dauncing. As for <hi>Nero,</hi> how much he was addic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſtudie of the Cytherne, and what great regard he had of his voyce, it is incredible to be ſpoken. This is one folly in him, and very ridiculus, that the ſame nyght which was the laſt of his lyfe, and the fyrſt to the world, to take breath, as it were, for a litle tyme, among the complayntes which inſtaunt death and preſent feare and ſorow dyd miniſter, this one thyng moſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and moſt miſerably he bewayled, not that ſo great a Prince, but that ſo great a Muſitian ſhoulde peryſh. I let paſſe others: euen vnto this your age which nowe is preſent, though but here and there, yet there is come ſome delyght of the eare, wherwith to be honeſtly and ſoberly delyghted, is a certayne humanitie, but to be caught, and as it were wedded vnto it, is great vanitie.</p>

                  <p>There is not in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyng ſo much a preſent delight, as an hope of pleaſure to come: For it is the forerunner of <hi>Venus,</hi> to leade about ſelly wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that are aſtoniſhed with the ſounde of the inſtrumentes, to court them, to claſpe them, and vnder colour of curteſie to wynne them: there the handes are free, the eyes free, and the ſpeech free, there is noyſe of the feete, the diſſonant voyces of the ſingers, the ſoundyng of the trumpets, the meeting togeather, the duſt, and that which is often added to playes and ſhewes, mght it ſelfe, eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to honeſtie, &amp; friend to vices: theſe be the things which driue

And, that ye ſhall not thinke me to be eaſily deceiued, this is that delight which ſimply, and as it were innocently ye profeſſe by the name of dauncinges, &amp; vnder the couering of paſtime, ye clooke wickedneſſe. And although ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times this be done among men only, or women only, they doo then but ſeuerally exerciſe themſelues, &amp; learne what they ſhal do when they meete againe: like as ſchollers do meditate while their maiſter is abſent, what they ſhal ſay when he returneth. Plucke vp by the coote this craftie and wicked ſhewe, take away laſciuiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and thou ſhalt take away dauncinges.

                  <p>I had rather thou haddeſt chooſen ſome other kinde of exerciſe. But I perceyue whereabout thou goeſt, and what thou meaneſt.
<pb facs="tcp:14998:42"/>Thou wouldeſt haue this generall reſtreinct taken away, thou wouldeſt haue libertie to be geuen, and an order therein to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. Foraſmuche as therefore thou art ſo minded, and ſuche is thy maner and cuſtome, then whiche if it be naught, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worſe, and if it be good, there is nothing better: let this be a rule vnto thee in al theſe thynges, that ſuche as thou canſt not altogether want, thou vſe them moſt modeſtly and ſeldome. That thou behaue not thy ſelfe ſoftly, nor womanlyke in any matter, but let thy manly rigour ſhewe it ſelfe, yea ſomwhat beyonde it owne boundes: and let thy dauncing, or what other paſtime ſoeuer thou frequent, be a relaxation to the weeried ſpirites, and an exerciſe to the body, and not a pleaſure to effeminate the minde. I woulde gladly abſtayne from examples, for the imitation of excellent men is not ſafe for al to folowe. Euery feathered foule is not able to folow the Eagle. Of imitatours, ſome imitate the contrary, ſome one thyng, and ſome another. Fewe doo fully attaine to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of that whiche they imitate. The younger <hi>Cato,</hi> when his minde was ouerpreſſed with cares of the Common wealth, was wont to refreſhe hym ſelfe with wine. The lyke did <hi>Solon</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Greekes. Now ſome man perhappes deſirous to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate theſe, wyll alwayes doo one thyng onely whiche they dyd, he wyll drynke: and that whiche they vſed to doo ſeldome tymes, and moderately, this man wyll doo continually, and immoderat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and that whiche they vſed for a remedie, he wyll abuſe vnto drunkenneſſe. The lyke may be eaſily ſhewed in other thinges al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: but nowe thou vnderſtandeſt, as well as I, what that is which I feare, with thee. Notwithſtanding, foraſmuch as thou haſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced me to vndertake the defence of a condemned matter, I wyl ſet downe vnto thee, the example of a notable perſonage, whiche thou ſhalt not folowe, or not chaunge, whiche I wyll recite vnto thee in theſe woordes, whiche <hi>Seneca</hi> vſeth in that booke where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſearcheth after the tranquillitie of the minde. <hi>Scipio,</hi> ſayth he, mooued that ſame his triumphant and martiall body, after the tune and meaſure of inſtrumentes, not wantonly mincing, as it is nowe the maner to ſwim in dauncing, far more effeminately then women, but as the auncient men in fore tyme were wont at playes and feſtiuall tymes to daunce, after a manlyke ſort, which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14998:42"/>ſhoulde no way impaire them, if their enimies dyd behold them. By whiche wordes, what he thought then of his owne age, may be perceiued: But he was happie that he ſawe not thyne. And although he doo allowe of ſome large ſcope of dauncing and drinking, ſaying, that ſomtimes it is lawfull for a man to drynke tyll he be drunke, whiche I merueill that ſo preciſe a diſpoſition woulde graunt: yet if thou wylt folowe faythfull counſell, drynke wine ſparyngly, and abſtayne from dauncing. There be other more honeſt kindes of recreation, wherewith thou mayeſt refreſh thy loathſome and weeried minde. But in all thynges this is the beſt counſell whiche he vttered laſt of all, to be circumſpect, and take heede: and whatſoeuer thou doeſt, ſo to doo it, as though thyne enimies behelde and marked thee: It is muche more bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to liue in ſuche ſort that thyne enimies may woonder at thine abſtynence and grauitie, then that thy freendes ſhoulde excuſe thy laſciuiouſneſſe. That good fame is more noble, when no man is able to obiect a true crime, and dare not obiect a falſe, then when a fault is obiected, and purged. Perfect vertue maketh the accuſer afeard: but that whiche is but meane, prouoketh hym. And as touching ſobrietie, I had rather thou were lyke <hi>Caeſar,</hi> whom his very enimies can not denie but that he was a man of lytle wine, as <hi>Suetonius</hi> writeth, then lyke <hi>Cato:</hi> I meane not the auncient <hi>Cato Cenſorius,</hi> of whoſe ſobrietie we haue ſpoken before, but the latter, whom <hi>Seneca</hi> in this ſort defendeth for drunkenneſſe obiected agaynſt him, that <hi>Catoes</hi> lyfe was ſuch, that a man may better obiect an honeſt crime agaynſt hym, then a diſhoneſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But concernyng that whereof nowe we entreat, I had rather thou ſhouldeſt not daunce at all, then to daunce as <hi>Scipio</hi> dyd.

But the coutage and heate of minde wrought no woonderfull thyng in hym whyle he liued. There was more ſtomacke in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi> although leſſe follie: for he buylded not a tombe for his horſe, but he made a graue, whiche thing notwithſtanding was vnmeete for his wit and grauitie. For whether <hi>Iulius Caeſars</hi> monſtrous horſe were by him (or any other) conſecrated with a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of marble before the temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> it may be doubted. <hi>Antonius Verus,</hi> who came after in yeeres and glory, but in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and imperiall name was but litle inferiour, that I may omit to tell what fare, and what furniture he ordeined for his horſe which he loued immoderately, truely he cauſed a ſtatue of gold to be made lyke hym, whyle he was alyue, and when he was dead, a ſepulture to be buylded (that we might be the more greeued at it) in <hi>Vaticanum,</hi> among ſo many holy bones as were there buried, &amp; to be buried.

<pb facs="tcp:14998:52"/>was gouerned by their orders, neuertheleſſe being either borne in the armes of his ſeruantes, or vpon ſome other horſe, and carying his Phyſitions with hym, he woulde goe viſite his ſicke horſe twice or thrice euery day, and ſorowfully ſighing, woulde ſit by hym, and gently ſtroke him with his hand, and comfort him with fayre ſpeech: To be ſhort, there was no kind of meanes by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke let paſſe vnaſſayed, and nothing omitted that might relieue his ſicke freend. Perhaps poſteritie wil cal this a tale, howbeit it is true, and knowen among a great people. Thus this noble gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, was as carefull for the good health of his horſe, as for his owne, and lamented for his death as he had been his ſonne.</p>

                  <p>Perhaps it is ſo in the ſight of the eye, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of the minde, but in very deede it is a burdenſome and troublous heape of pelfe: but there is nothing more hungry and miſerable, then couetouſneſſe, whoſe greedineſſe is prouoked by the thinges that are ſought, and yet when they be obteyned, they haue no taſte: foraſmuche as while they are hoped for, they ſhine, and whyle they are poſſeſſed, they waxe vile: ſo that whyle many a man thinketh he hath won wealth, he hath gayned but ſorow &amp; carefulneſſe. Theſe are thy deere burdens: but if thou chaunce to beholde any dearer and more precious, or dayly beholding them take away thy wondring, thou wylt not eſteeme them. But admit thou loue them ſtyll, and thy wondring at them do continue: doth there not alſo withal a difficult &amp; perpetual errour remayne?

A woorthy knowledge truely, whiche neglecting the woorſhipping of GOD, the care of the minde, and the knowledge of them both, geueth it ſelfe onely to the

But this is the worlde: And this is not the fyrſt tyme that they are muche accompted that craftily make prices of them: as for the true prices, there are none at all, or not knowen.

And to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng of thoſe two thinges whiche you make accompt of, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more vile: the two laſt things, &amp; therewith alſo great riches, and whatſoeuer els ye eſteeme moſt precious, I wyll prooue that they haue geuen place to the price &amp; loue of a precious ſtone, and that the keeping thereof hath been preferred before exile and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie: yea and if neede had ſo required, before death alſo. Who knoweth not of <hi>Nonius</hi> practice in the like caſe? This <hi>Nonius</hi> was a Senator of <hi>Rome,</hi> and a very riche Gentleman, and had a precious ſtone eſteemed as twentie thouſande crownes, and the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14998:58"/>ſtones name was <hi>Opalus.</hi> It groweth in <hi>India,</hi> gliſteryng with varietie of all colours.

Who wyll not thynke well of that, whereunto a Senatour bare ſo great affection? And truely one of theſe twayne we muſt needes graunt, eyther that the Iewell was of great value, or that the owner was of a haſe mynde. But thou lookeſt not to knowe whiche of theſe twayne I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude to be trueſt. For although the iudgement of this and ſuche lyke, or rather the infection of them whiche they leaue in the mynde, haue farre and wyde infected the maners of the common multitude: notwithſtandyng, it behooueth great wittes, neyther to be delyghted with money, nor any thyng els, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng the beautie of vertue onely: vnleſſe it be, that through the meanes of theſe ſhort pleaſures whiche delyght the eyes, the mynde, beyng ſtyrred vp, be taken with the loue and deſyre of the eternal beautie, from whiche fountaine it ſpringeth whatſoeuer is fayre.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:14998:59"/>nowe a dayes among the common Iewellers and Lapidaries. And this laſt, the opinion of certayne auncient writers, according to whoſe iudgement, the Diamond, whiche is not only the moſt precious of al ſtones, but of all earthly thinges, was wont to be the Jewel and gemme in olde time of kinges, and not all, but of the chiefeſt.

I wyll touche one onely, and whiche is greateſt of all, to the ende thou mayeſt vnderſtande, howe daungerous this follie is to the weaker mindes, whiche hath inuaded the moſt hygh and valiant. <hi>Pompeius,</hi> ſurnamed the great, the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent of all the Romane captaines (I meane of the latter ſort, who, how much they excel the reſidue in noble exploites, and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant deedes, ſo muche they are inferiour vnto their forefathers in modeſtie of maners, and frugalitie of lyfe) when he returned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour out of Spayne, from ſubduing the Weſt partes of the worlde, and had dryuen the theeues and pyrates into one place togeather, to whom the name of <hi>Conuenae,</hi> meeters together,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14998:59"/>was geuen, whiche ſhall laſt for euer. There vpon the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> mountaynes, the ſharpeneſſe of the place perhappes aſſiſting, and modeſtie helping the matter, and abatyng the pryde of his age and victorie, he ſet vp a manlyke Trophei, and monument, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in maner of a counterfeite, of his naturall and rough vizage: being then great in deede and magnificiall, who although he were but young in yeeres, yet was he olde in maners, and rype in minde. The ſame man afterwarde, when he had taken the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and vanquiſhed the Eaſt, beyng then changed, as it were with the alteration of the tyme and place, and returnyng another man, from another part of the worlde, he ſhewed in triumphe not his humilitie, but his manly countenaunce, become more effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate then before, after a womaniſhe, or diuine maner, not portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Braſſe or Marble, but adorned with rare and exquiſite pearles. This is no ſmall rebuke, for the pryde and ſpoyle of the Eaſt, to be layde vpon the head of one man, not without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultyng of the conquering people, and to the excuſing of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that ſhoulde enſue. For what ſhoulde not Rome (being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde in ſlauerie vnder tyrantes) ſuffer, which being free, behelde this ſo great inſolencie, of a moſt louyng citizen. As for the other furnitures of his triumphe, whiche was more humble or ſober, they are not mencioned, neyther the armour and horſes of the ſubdued nations, as the maner was wont to be, nor the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, charrets, nor other booties: The vileſt thynges whiche we reave to haue been there, was golde, precious ſtones, and pearles.

In this prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Iewell, as <hi>Solinus</hi> tearmeth it, were not ingrauen, but naturally imprinted the portraitures of the nine Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and <hi>Apollo</hi> the notable Muſitian playing in the middeſt of them: theſe ſpottes and markes of the ſtone ſo lynked one to another, that within that ſpace, whiche was but very lytle, euery Image and portraiture myght be diſcerned by it owne ſpeciall notes, as they were placed within the ring, and for farther ornament, the kynges name was alſo thereunto ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For ſuche thynges as belong to great perſonages, are the more eſteemed. But I pray you, what good dyd this <hi>Achate</hi> vnto hym? Dyd it make hym inuincible in battayle, or ſaue hym from death, or coulde it delyuer hym from the reioycyng of his enimies, or from the ſtone whiche the hande of a woman threwe at hym? What, I ſay, auayled it vnto <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> to haue hadde that ſtone? or what hindred it <hi>Fabritius</hi> and <hi>Curius</hi> that they wanted it, by which two valiaunt captaines he was vanquiſhed, and driuen out of <hi>Italy?</hi> I dare affirme, that neither of theſe twayne would ſo much yeelde in minde vnto him, as to make exchange of their harde and rough helmet, for his ſwoorde that was ſo beſet with golde

                  <p>Perhaps there is ſome other cauſe of ſo feruent deſire: For it is not the gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering only that allureth thee, but ſome hydden vertue. For who is able to declare all the operations and vertues of precious ſtones: Thus I ſay then, yf al thoſe thynges that are reported or written of them, the ſeuenth part were true, it were a worthye matter: but neyther the ſeuentie part, neyther the ſeuenſcore is true in deede. And yf, as <hi>Plinius</hi> ſayth, <hi>there be no one deceypt in the lyfe of man more gaynefull,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:14998:63"/>who wyl ma ruayle yf there be none more plentifull? Not that there is more common ſale of precious ſtones, then of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thyng, as beyng ſuche thyngs as the preciouſneſſe of them maketh them rare, but that the trueth is neuer more rare in any merchandize. For in no ware is there leſſe lybertie of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentyng, or more libertie of lying, or more vantage of vntrue dealyng, or impudency more free, or the cuſtome of vſyng it more common. But yf perhaps among all theſe vertues there be any thyng true, ſhal we accompt this to be it whiche the auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of Magiciens confirmeth, and the opinion of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people eſtablyſhed vppon the ſame auoweth, that the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>methiſt</hi> withſtandeth drunkenneſſe? Is it then without cauſe, that this precious ſtone is meete to make cuppes of for drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? Nowe I ieſt with thee: Ieſtyng many tymes prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth anger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to wyt, in aſcribyng that to one, whiche another hath deſerued: vnleſſe we wyl ſay, that this was the wyt and deuiſe of pleaſure, that the drinkers ſight might be delited together with his taſt, and ſo the ſenſes being tickled on al ſides, the drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe might be the more curious and merie. This, vnleſſe I be deceiued, is the trueſt and moſt certayne cauſe of this matter, both in other, and alſo in this, which is ſpecially prouided as it were a captayne agaynſt drunkenneſſe, ouer which ſobrietie onely may triumph, in vſing litle wine, accordyng to the ſaying of that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent counſeller, &amp; that not to be drunke for pleaſure, but for profite, to abando<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the infirmities of the ſtomacke, with a litle ſmal wine, I ſay, delayed with water, to auoyde the force and rage of ſtrong and myghtie wynes, and to quenche and brydle them, as it were with a floodde of water, to knowe and remember that in hotte and ſtrong wyne, and often, or to muche drynkyng of it, there lurketh muche matter of ſhame, ſorowe, and repentaunce, that whyther ſoeuer thou turneſt thy ſelfe, this is alwayes in mens eyes, and that no man of a ſounde mynde can diſſemble it. Theſe be the profitable weapons agaynſt that Monſter. What place is there here nowe left for the <hi>Amethiſt,</hi> or for any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtone? The Magiciens haue deuyſed that lye, and there haue been ſome that haue beleeued, that by the vertue of this ſtone, promyſyng the in ſobrietie, they myght boldly quaffe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

This is therfore the ſumme of all, there is nothyng els that procureth vnto you this and ſuche lyke follies, but pleaſure, prouoked and incenſed with dangers, but ſpecially pryde and forgetfulnes of your ſtate, and an hurtful feare of mynde, which beyng ſuch, as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng more hurtful to the lyfe of man, ſo I marueyle that there is nothing more pleaſant, I ſay not, in that vertue, beyng ſo great a good, ſeemeth but vyle in your iudgement, but your lyfe, your health, your ſafetie, your ryches, and finally your pleaſures, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che in your iudgementes are the chiefeſt felicitie. All theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges geue place vnto pryde only, this aboue all other thynges ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth you to couet precious ſtones, which are euermore vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, many times hurtful, and neuer neceſſary.

Couetouſneſſe peraduenture, which the name it ſelfe importeth, might indifferently content her ſelfe with a great portion of golde, and laſciuiouſnes repoſe her ſelfe in her banquettes and pleaſures, pryde only neuer reſteth, ſo long as ſhe ſeeth any thyng aboue her, who at the fyrſt begynnyng of al thynges, ſought to make her ſelfe equall with GOD, and the very ſame enforceth you paynfully to ſeeke for precious ſtones, and curyouſly to ioyne or hollowe them, to the entent that when ye gooe abroade, or ſytte in open places in iudgement of Courtes, or at Feaſtes, ye may ſhyne and glyſter lyke Starres, and continually repyne at the beautie of heauen. And to returne to my purpoſe, by the meanes of this guyde, with your houſes, with your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrel, with your meate and drynke, and generally with all your thynges whiche were inuented to ſerue eyther the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie

And to admit that the integritie of aucthours were perfect &amp; abſolute, what writer is able to remedie ignorance and ſlouthfulneſſe, whiche corrupt and confounde al thynges? For feare whereof, many excellent wyttes haue geuen ouer ſundry worthie workes, and our moſt lewde age is deſeruedly plagued with this punyſhment, whiche is careful of the Kytchyn, and negligent of learnyng, &amp; encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth Cookes, and not wryters. And therfore, whoſoeuer can a litle blot paper with ynke, and knoweth howe to holde a pen in his fyngers, ſhalbe counted a wryter, yea, although he be voide of all learnyng, without wyt, and deſtitute of knowledge. I doo not ſeeke nowe, nor complayne of Orthographie, whiche is long ſince peryſhed, I woulde to GOD they coulde wryte by one meanes or other indifferently that whiche they be wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, then the weakeneſſe of the wryter woulde appeare, and the ſubſtaunce of the thynges not lye vnknowne. But nowe by meanes of their confuſed copies &amp; regiſters, promiſing to write one thyng, they wryte ſo another, that a man cannot tell hym ſelfe what he wylled them to wryte. If <hi>Cicero</hi> or <hi>Liuius,</hi> and many other of the famous auncient wryters, ſhoulde come agayne into the worlde, but ſpecially <hi>Plinius</hi> the ſeconde, and reade theyr owne woorkes, woulde they vnderſtand, and not in many places doubt, whether theſe were theyr owne woorkes, or ſome barbarous wryter? Among ſo many ruins of humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions, the holy Scripture remayneth, both by meanes of the more ſpeciall care of men, but chiefly by the expreſſe woorking of God the aucthour thereof, who defendeth his holy woorde, his ſacred Hiſtories, and diuine lawes, and geueth continuance vnto his inuentions. The moſt principall of all other artes doo peryſh, and the greateſt part of them are loſt. Thus of ſo great a loſſe there is no remedie, becauſe there is no perceyuyng of it, which in this caſe is no ſtrange thyng, for the great loſſes of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
<pb facs="tcp:14998:72"/>and manners, are neglected. Nowe when ye prouyd for ſmal matters with ſuch diligence, ye accompt of the loſſe of learnyng among trifles, and there be ſome that reckon it among gayne. There was one of late, not in the fieldes or wooddes, but that which thou mayeſt the more marueyle at, in a great and moſte floryſhyng Citie of <hi>Italie,</hi> not a ſhephearde or a ploughman, but a Noble man, and of great credite among the people of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey where he dwelt, who ſware that he woulde geue a great ſumme of money, vpon condition there woulde neuer any lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man come in and dwel in the countrey where he inhabited. Oh wycked voyce of a ſtony hart. It is reported alſo, that <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinius</hi> was of the ſame mynd, and loathed learnyng, which (as it is written) he tearmed a common poyſon and peſtilence. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, perhaps his rude and clounyſhe byrth may excuſe his folly: But ſurely yf he had ben aduaunced to the ſtate of an Emperour, he woulde not haue abandoned that nature.

But nowe is it no ſmall pleaſure to the minde to vnderſtande, vnleſſe the proud hand make haſte alſo to pen and paper? and whoſoeuer doth vnderſtand, or thynke that he vnderſtandeth ſome ſmal peece of a booke, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth he hym ſelfe meete by and by to write bookes?

Whiche commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement al contemners of al preceptes doo obey: for all doo write. And yf, as I haue ſayd, there be ſo great danger in thoſe that write other mens bookes, what ſhall we thynke of them that write their owne, and them that be newe? Whereby they bring into the worlde doubtful and damnable artes and opinions, or that, which is the leaſt miſchiefe that they commit, they weerie men with theyr rude and vnpleaſaunt ſtyle, inſomuche as who ſo wanteth in them promptneſſe of witte, yf he lyſt to looſe his tyme and beſtowe the traueyle of his yeeres, he ſhall not want weerineſſe. This is the fruite (and none other) of your inuentions, to infect or affect, but ſeldome or neuer to refreſhe.

Thus, as thou ſeeſt, we gather the moſt choyce and woorthy examples: As for the common ſort, both of cities, and vulgare lyfe and trade of men, whiche are full of ſuche lyke complaintes, I let them paſſe. Whiche beyng ſo, ſince in all kyndes of thoſe thynges whiche ſeeme moſt deere, what by priuie hatred, or open diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, oftentymes there is muche bitterneſſe, freendſhyp onely is voyde of ſuche griefe and diſpleaſure, and freendes neuer not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not flue or deſtroyed, but dyd not ſo muche as hurt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther willingly: Wherefore yf thou haue founde ſuche a freende as thou ſpeakeſt of, perſwade thy ſelfe that thou haſt founde a great treaſure, and take heede thou doo not as the common ſort of people doo, who geuyng them ſelues to the ſearchyng and folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng after vile matters, and contemnyng excellent thynges, doo buſie them ſelues more with tyllyng their lande, and folowing their trade of Merchandize, then in ſeekyng of freendes, and enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of vertue, and ſo haply thou neglect this commoditie whiche thou haſt gotten.

Who woulde diſdayne the plough and the harrowe, whiche that triumphant and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical hande touched, whiche had purchaſed ſo many notable victories ouer ſo many enimies, had wrytten ſo many excellent woorkes of worthie matter, apparteynyng both to Philoſophie, Hiſtorie, or common vſe of lyfe, as are thoſe bookes which he wrote concernyng this matter whereof we nowe entreate? He was the fyrſt amongſt you that geathered the preceptes of Huſbandrie, and brought them into the fourme of an Art, and ſet them downe in wrytyng: after whom there folowed many other, whereof ſome haue aduaunced that poore and ſymple ſkyl, in woorthy and excellent verſes, whiche nowe callyng to my mynde, and not forgetful of mans neceſſitie, truely I doo not nowe diſcommende of Huſbandrie. Notwithſtandyng, neyther the excellencie of wryters, neyther the feare of pouertie, ſhal euer conſtrayne me to iudge it meete to be preferred or matched with the liberal and commendable artes? although the firſt age of the empire had thoſe that were both valiant captaynes, and good huſbandmen, but now by continuance of tyme the caſe is altered. Howbeit, it happeneth not now through the frailtie of nature, that your wittes are not ſufficient to atteyne vnto thynges of ſo diuers nature: And therefore in this age, I wyll permit that excellent perſonages geue theyr myndes ſometyme to Huſban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie, not to make it a toyle, or theyr trade of lyuyng, but rather for theyr recreations, &amp; to put greater cares out of theyr heades, as namely, ſometyme to graffe the tender twygge vppon the buddyng ſtocke, or to correct the ranke leaues with the cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked hooke, or to lay quyckſettes into the Dyke in hope of increaſe, or to bryng the ſyluer ſtreames by newe dygged
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:14998:89"/>furrowes into the thirſtie mebowes, I am content to geue theſe men licence after this maner earneſtly to buſie them ſelues, to dygge, and delue: but wholly to apply the minde vnto the earth, vnleſſe neceſſitie conſtrayne thereunto, I count it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meete and vndecent for a learned and valiaunt man, who can not lyghtly want ſome matter of more noble exerciſe. The good mother Nature, when ſhe gaue many artes vnto men, ſhe made a difference alſo between their wittes and diſpoſitions, that euery one ſhould followe that, where vnto he was moſt euclyned. Thou ſhalt finde ſome one, who beyng of an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent witte, can ſo cunnyngly eyther tyll the lande, or ſayle ouer the ſeas, that in this behalfe no Philoſophers wyſedome may be compared to his induſtrie. It is a follie, and a bootleſſe thyng, to contende with another man, not in thyne owne, but in his art: wherein, although otherwyſe thou excell hym, and be hygher, as they ſay, then hee by the head and ſhoulders, yet thou ſhalt be founde his vnderlyng, and where thou art ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour in the greateſt matters, thou mayeſt eaſily be ouercome in many ſmall.</p>

But thus it fareth, you wyl rule al, to be ſeruantes your ſelues to ſenſualitie. And this folly is not newe, nor of the common ſort, but aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and of the chiefeſt. Fyſhpondes and Weares for Oyſters, dyd <hi>Sorgius Orata</hi> fyrſt appoynt at the ſhore <hi>Barane.</hi> About the ſame tyme <hi>Licinius Muraena</hi> began the Weares for other fiſhes: who both tooke theyr ſurnames of a fyſhe. Theſe are woorthy cauſes of a ſurname, to wyt, for that one of them loued the Gyſthead, the other the Lamprey. Theſe be they that haue deſerued the tytles to be called <hi>Africani,</hi> or <hi>Macedonici:</hi> and perhaps theſe men haue taken no leſſe paynes in takyng and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowyng theyr fyſhe, and in buyldyng theyr Weares, then <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi> and <hi>Paulus</hi> dyd in deliueryng and beautifiyng theyr coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, with theyr conqueſtes and triumphes. And therefore it is very true whiche ſome ſay, <hi>In quantitie al mens cares are almoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, but in qualitie farre vnequal.</hi> And as euyll examples haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes plentie of folowers, after this <hi>Licinius,</hi> there folowed noble men, <hi>Philip, Hortentius,</hi> and <hi>Lucullus</hi> alſo, a man o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe of famous memorie, who not being contented with a ſimple Weare, neere vnto Naples, he cauſed an Hill to be cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: whiche ſtoode hym in as great charges as the buylding of his countrey houſe, or vyllage, deuiſing a place of reſt for the fyſhes whiche he had taken, by the cutting away of a ſtop whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was made of hard rocke, and lettyng in the Sea, as it were a cauline Hauen. And therefore <hi>Pompeius</hi> the great, who deuiſed not only Weares, but Empires alſo, not improperly termed this <hi>Lucullus</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romane <hi>Xerxes,</hi> that is to ſay, a dygger away of hilles. What ſhal I ſay of others? The firſt that made Weares for Lampreis, was one <hi>Curus,</hi> I know not what he was;
<pb facs="tcp:14998:95"/>for, notwithſtandyng al his Lampreys, he is ſcarſe yet knowen, whereof he had ſuch plentie, that with ſixe thouſande of them he furniſhed <hi>Iulius Caeſars</hi> triumphant ſupper. This man had alſo his imitatours, namely <hi>Hortentius</hi> the oratour, of whom we ſpake before, a man that neuer failed in folowyng an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of wantonnes: and therefore it falleth out many tymes, that your learnyng nothing abateth your madneſſe: but it neuer brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth any thyng that a man may woonder at, whyleſt they that haue attayned vnto learnyng, thynke that it is lawful for them to doo euery thyng, and arrogate muche vnto them ſelues, whiche they durſt not, if they had not learnyng. It is reported therefore that this man had a Weare at the ſhore of the <hi>Baiane</hi> coaſt, whereas, among other fyſhes whiche he had, he loued ſo dearely one certayne Lamprey, that he mourned for him when he was dead. Beholde a woorthy loue, and meete to prouoke ſo graue a man to teares. He that (as it is read) neyther be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayled the ciuil warres of his tyme, nor the proſcriptions and ſlaughter of the Citizens, neyther yet woulde haue lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ouerthrowe at <hi>Cannas,</hi> yf it had happened in his tyme, dyd he weepe for the death of a Lamprey? This lightneſſe is ſo great, that that whiche is of later dayes muſt needes be pardoned. The age and ſexe of <hi>Antonia</hi> maketh her follie more excuſable, who is reported, not to haue wept for her Lamprey, but while he was liuyng, to haue decked him foorth with ringes and iewels of golde, inſomuche that the ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſight, cauſed many folkes to repaire to <hi>Paulos<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> for that was the name of the vyllage, lying in the <hi>Baiane</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines. There were alſo Weares of Wylkes and Perewincles, and other vanities concernyng fyſhes, and ſpecially the Pyke of <hi>Tibur,</hi> whiche was taken betweene the two brydges. But I haue ſpoken yenough of other mens errours, in whiche the moe thou ſeeſt enwrapped, the more diligent take thou heede leaſt thou be ſnared in the lyke: neyther doo I nowe forbydde thee the vſe of fyſhes, but only the ouer muche care of vyle and vnnoble thynges.</p>

Propertius, Tibullus,</hi> who haue written al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt none other thyng then loue: Howbeit, why ſhould I blame the Poetes, vnto whom there is graunted more libertie in wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng, and not rather the Philoſophers, which are the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and leaders of lyfe? In whiche reſpect thou maieſt alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, that there was muche more grauitie in yours, then in the Greeke Philoſophers. For among yours, thou ſhalt ſcarcely fynde one, that hath not only not committed any ſuch follie, but alſo laughed at it, and condempned. But among them, a man would woonder, not only at the common ſort of them, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo at the <hi>Stoikes,</hi> whiche are the moſt preciſe ſect of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, yea <hi>Plato</hi> hym ſelfe, whom we knowe to haue been in this errour. The <hi>Stoikes</hi> wyl haue a wyſe man to loue: and truely yf they can agree vppon the kynde of loue, they are not deceyued: For as I haue ſayde, a wyſe man wil loue GOD, and his neighbour, and vertue, and wyſedome, and his countrey, and his parentes, and his chyldren, and his brethren, and his friendes: and yf he be a perfect wyſe man, he wyll loue alſo his enimies, not for theyr owne ſakes, I confeſſe, but for his ſake that ſo commaundeth. Among al theſe thynges, I pray thee, what place is there lefte for beautie? For thus we reade it defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Ciceroes Tuſculane</hi> queſtions, <hi>That loue is an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to make friendſhyp, in reſpest of beautie.</hi> But who is ſo blind, that ſeeth not what this beautie meaneth? And therefore <hi>Cicero</hi> aptly demaundeth this queſtion, <hi>What loue of friendſhip is this,</hi> ſayth he? <hi>Why wyll not any loue an euyl fauoured young man, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a wel fauoured olde woman? forſooth, age and fauour are here ſpecially reſpected, which are the foundations of this friendſhip, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che by a more honeſt name, is rather called friendſhip then luſt, or ſenſualitie, but what in deede it is, it may be eaſily perceiued by open &amp; ſound eyes.</hi> And therfore the matter commeth to this iſſue, that if there be any loue in al the world, without careful or vnhoneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, without ſighings and burning grief, the ſame is graunted to a wyſe man: it muſt be without al maner luſt or laſciuiouſnes, as the ſame <hi>Cicero</hi> ſayth, <hi>and without al vexation and trouble of mind, which of wyſe men are ſpecially to be auoyded.</hi> For as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:14998:103"/>of thynges may be couered by ſpeach, ſo can not the trueth of them be changed: and we ſpeake now of none other then the libidinous and ſenſual loue which cannot poſſibly be without many of theſe, and other great euyls. And thus much concerning the <hi>Stoikes.</hi> Now I come to <hi>Plato,</hi> who is called the prince, yea, the God of Philoſophers. And although there be great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention among many in this poynt, notwithſtandyng in euery controuerſie we muſt ſtand to the iudgement of the auncient and better ſort, and not of the greater number. <hi>Plato,</hi> I ſay, this great Philoſopher (that I may ſpeake if by the licence of ſo woorthy a man) hath written much more licentiouſly concernyng his filthy loues, although to a true philoſopher in deede, there is no luſt that is not filthy, and not to be alowed, then becommeth the name and grauitie of <hi>Plato</hi> to haue written. He hath written notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and, for which I am the more ſory, his works be extant, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was he aſhamed of the blot of ſo renowmed fame, nor the iudgement of poſteritie, the force of this paſſion of his mynde, and the ſweetneſſe of his ſtile which pricked foorth his pen, ſo far ouercommyng his care and feare in this behalfe, whiche he had now ſo abundantly in this filthie and ſhameful argument, that a man may ſooner diſcerne the beames of the Platonicke wit, in the wrytinges of the Epicures, then of the folowers of <hi>Plato.</hi> And this I perceyue to haue been the cauſe that many forſooke theyr wrytynges, which they myght eyther more honeſtly not haue written at al, or more wyſely haue ſuppreſſed, and alſo, as I geſſe, wylbe the cauſe heareafter that many wil do the lyke: but I haue now touched the chiefeſt. Thus haue I ſayde ſomewhat concernyng the reprehenſion of this madneſſe, and much more al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo may be ſayde, and for remedy therof not a litle.

To be ſhort, among al that I haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and liked, theſe are in few: changyng of place, whiche as it is ſometyme holſome for the body, ſo is it alſo for the diſeaſed minde: diligent eſchewing of al thynges whereby the countenance of the beloued may be brought into remembrance: alſo buſiyng of the minde, and eftſoones conuertyng it vnto new cares and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, wherby the foote ſteppes of the former diſeaſe may be vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extynguiſhed: earneſt and continual thynkyng how ſhameful, how ſorowful, how miſerable, and laſtly, how ſhort, how ſlipperie, and how ſmal a thing it is that is ſought for by ſo many dangers and troubles, how much more eaſily and commodiouſly it might otherwyſe eyther be fulfylled, or wholy reiected, and reputed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the moſt vyleſt thyngs.

For it is in the choyce of hym that is ſicke, to be made whole, ſo ſoone as he begynneth to haue a wyll to be whole, and can finde in his harte to breake of the pleaſant linkes of their ſweete companie, which is an hard matter to doo, I confeſſe, but poſſible to hym that is willing. For as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſayeth moſt grauely, This is to be declared which is found to be in euery perturbation, that it is nothing but in opinion, in the iudgment, and in the wyl. For yf loue were naturall, then all ſhould loue, &amp; ſhould alwayes loue, &amp; al loue one thyng, and then ſhame ſhould not deterre one, and muſing another, and ſaſietie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:14998:104"/>For this laſt, which is ſacietie or fulneſſe, is by ſome num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred among the remedies, and ſo is alſo a newe loue, wherby the old is dryuen foorth, as it were one nayle by another: which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though vnto <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> kyng of <hi>Perſia,</hi> whom the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calleth <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> it was put in mynd by friendes, and found profitable by effect, as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> declareth the matter more at large. I contend not of the euent, but I ſpeake of the choyce. And therefore truely I haue ben of opinion, that theſe two remedies haue ſometyme been profitable, but alwayes dangerous: and yf with none of theſe, nor with them al thou canſt recouer, then muſt thou in thy mynde run to the cauſes of the diſeaſe. Theſe, as I ſuppoſe, are the cheifeſt and greateſt of al, health, beautie, and good fauour, ryches, leaſure, youth. And as contraryes doo beſt cure the diſeaſes of the body, ſo wyl they excellently remedy the minde alſo, as ſickneſſe, deformitie, pouertie, great buſineſſe, and olde age, which is a worthy refourmer of the errours of youth. Theſe be my laſt remedies, which are hard in deede, but in reſpect of the greatneſſe of the plague, to be wyſhed.</p>

This is iniurious, I confeſſe, but ſo common, that complayntes are not ſo often made of the enimies. Thou haſt hearde in <hi>Lucane.</hi> how <hi>Photinus</hi> complayneth of <hi>Pompeius,</hi>

Among theſe thinges I do not recken, how that he had determined in his minde to make a cut through <hi>Iſthmus</hi> the hyl of <hi>Corinth,</hi> which although it woulde haue ben a woorke of great charges, yet had it been profitable for ſea faring men, whereby the two ſeas had been made one, and they that had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from <hi>Brunduſium</hi> to <hi>Athens,</hi> or <hi>Chalcis,</hi> or <hi>Byzantium,</hi> ſhoulde haue auoyded the great crooke of <hi>Achaia.</hi> Next followeth <hi>Nero,</hi> matche and ſuperiour vnto him in madneſſe, whoſe diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate expences had no meaſure, ſpecially in building, wherein he ſurpaſſed all prodigal fooles, and him ſelfe alſo.

                  <p>But more honeſt to forgeue: Mercy hath commended many, but reuengement none: there is nothing among men ſo neceſſary, or ſo common, as forgeueneſſe: for there is no man but offendeth, and no man but he hath neede of mercy, whiche being denyed, who ſhal take away ſo great abundance of faultes &amp; offences, or renue the broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> league of humane ſocietie?

Spare therfore, be mercyful, and moderate thy mind. Do thou ſo vnto a man, as thou wouldſt haue
<pb facs="tcp:14998:136"/>another man, yea God hym ſelfe, do vnto thee. Impudent is he that deſireth pardon of his lord and maiſter, and denieth the ſame to his felow ſeruant.

But how it may be lawful for a Chriſtian to ſue for the popedome, that hath propoſed to hym to ſerue and beare the yoke of his lorde, I do not perceiue, and to ſue for it, not onely by moſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh prodigalitie, but alſo, that is not much leſſe vile, by flatterie &amp; lyes, which are aries vnmeete for men, but ſo common and vſual now a dayes, that theſe are onely the meanes to come to prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <p>Thou art happie, and a ſtrange wayfaring man, a woonderfull runner, which in this ſtonye and difficult path art happy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toſſed among ſo manie thouſand dangers, not knowing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou art heere happy, which as I ſuppoſe neuer any man was, nor neuer ſhalbe: for who was euer happy in miſerie? Therfore, there is none happy before he paſſe out of this vale of miſerie. Among al the men in the world, there are twayne counted hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, of whiche the moſt eſpeciall is <hi>Quintus Metellus,</hi> both by writers and common report reputed happy. Neuertheleſſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the name of happyneſſe be very large and amply taken, I knowe it is taken from hym by certayne preciſe wryters, by reaſon of moſt grieuous iniuries whiche he ſuſteyned, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the griefe, at the handes of a vyle perſon. Nowe the falſe felicitie of other is euydent. <hi>Scilla</hi> was only called happie, notwithſtandyng, the haynouſneſſe of his lyfe &amp; death, do prooue that he was vnfortunate. Although <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Macedonie,</hi> and <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> had moſt proſperous fortune, yet theyr lyues were euer vnquiet and troubleſome, and therefore were not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, for they both had violent deathes: the one in middle courſe of his warres, the other after his conqueſt ſodaynly: the one pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by poyſon, the other by weapon. The Martiall felicitie of the <hi>Scipioes,</hi> in the one, is by his vnwoorthy exile, in the other, by his ſhameful and vnreuenged death, diminiſhed. It
<pb facs="tcp:14998:145"/>were ouerlong to recount euery ones fortune, and therefore I come to the laſt. Only <hi>Auguſtus</hi> the Emperour ſeemed almoſt vnto al men to be happy, both for the excellency of his Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, continuance of peace, length of his lyfe, and pleaſant ende thereof, and which exceedeth all, perpetual tranquilitie of minde and manners: who wyl deny that he was moſt happy? But they that haue applyed themſelues to ſearche after the trueth, wyll not graunt that he was happy. For the inwarde ſtate of his domeſticall lyfe, hyndred his outward glory, and the change of his fortune, much altered his want of natural and Male iſſue, the vntymely death of his Adoptyues and Nephues, and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towardneſſe of ſome of them more woorſe then death: Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, the treaſon and ſecrete practiſes of certayne moſt vyle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and often conſpiracies of his owne kynſfolke agaynſt hym, the common whoredomes of his moſt dearely beloued and only daughter, &amp; Neece: finally, an heyre that was none of his owne, and a ſucceſſour that he lyked not of, whom he choſe rather of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie then of iudgement, beyng vnworthy of ſuch an Emperour and Empire. If then none of theſe were happy, eyther ſhew me ſome other happy man, with whom thou mayeſt be happy, or els be thou happy alone, or els at length encline thine eare to the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er opinion, accordyng to the purport wherof I ſay agayne, that there is no man happy before his death.</p>

For the <hi>Latines</hi> haue deriued this woord diuination, <hi>a Diuis,</hi> from the goddes, or <hi>a Diuinitate,</hi> from <hi>Diuinitie:</hi> but the <hi>Grecians</hi> fetch their woord <hi>Mantice, a Furore,</hi> from madnes: you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more finely, but they more truely. The ſame art al the holy Doctours doo by one content condemne, namely <hi>Ambroſe, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> with the reſidue, who, if it ſo happen at any time, as this peſtilent cuſtome hath preuailed among many, that among theſe brablers in diſputation concernyng the trueth, they are had in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition for the very names ſake of theyr profeſſion, ſo that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours of the true fayth cannot be hearde, with the free conſent alſo of all other, who beyng innumerable are of the ſame opinion. And although the godly or vertuous men do condemne diuinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what cauſe is there, or iuſt occaſion of ſuſpition, but that only one, and eſpecially among many, the moſt excellent <hi>Cicero</hi> may be regarded and hearkened vnto: For truely he condemneth, moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, and deſpiſeth this whole kinde of illuſions and deceipts. And to be ſhort, omitting thoſe thyngs whiche this place cannot holde, not only al godly religion, but alſo true Philoſophie, and likewiſe Poetrie, which directly imitateth the ſame, and not the holy men only, but alſo all the learned, do reiect this vanitie, except thoſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that lyue of it, or that beyng by them ſeduced, are fallen into theyr ſnares, vppon whoſe loſſes and errours they founde theyr Art, and rayſe theyr gayne. In which Art, this is the chiefe and principal point, to cloke theyr fraude with obſcuritie, and ſo to geue an ambiguous or doubtful anſwere, ſo that whatſoeuer hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, may ſeeme to haue ben foretolde, which is a common proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo among al that profeſſe the knowledge of thyngs to come, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in not theyr Art, whiche is none, nor theyr wyt, which without learnyng and knowledge in matters is naked, but theyr ſubtiltie

The Starres moue againſt the ſwift firmament: the elementes of contrarie qualities ſtriue one againſt another: the earth trembleth, the ſeas flowe, the land ſhaketh, the fires crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, and the windes be at perpetuall conflict among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: on time contendeth againſt another time, euerie thing againſt another thing, and all things againſt vs: the Spring is moyſt, the Sommer drie, Harueſt pleaſant, and Winter ſharpe: and this which is called chaunge and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is in verie deede, ſtrife and diſagreement. Theſe things therefore vpon which we dwell, by which wee liue and are nouriſhed, which flatter vs with ſo manie entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, notwithſtanding howe terrible they are, when they begin once to be angrie, the earthquakes, and moſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whirlewindes, ſhipwrackes, and burnings raging vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, or in the aire, doe ſufficientlie declare. With what violence doeth haill fall? What force is there in ſtormes and tempeſtes? What ratling of thunder, what rage of lightning, what furie and feruencie of the waues,
<pb facs="tcp:14998:164"/>what bellowing of the Sea, what roaring of flooddes, what excurſion of riuers, what courſe, recourſe, and concourſe of cloudes? The ſea it ſelfe, beſides the manifeſt and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible rage of windes, and ſecret ſwelling of the flooddes which come by vncerteine turnes, hath alſo certeine and determined times of ebbes and flooddes, in manie other places, but moſt euidentlie in the Weſt. Which thing, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt the ſecret cauſe of the manifeſt motion is ſought after, hath raiſed no leſſe contention in the ſcooles of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, than in the ſea, of the floodes. Yea, moreouer, there is no liuing creature without warre: Fiſhes, wilde beaſtes, foules, ſerpentes, men: one kinde of theſe perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth another, none of theſe are at quiet. The Lion follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the woolfe, the woolfe the dogge, the dogge the Hare, with vnquencheable hatred. There is alſo a more couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kinde of dogges, which vſeth not onelie to fight with woolfes, but alſo to hunt Lions, Leopardes, wilde Bores, &amp; ſuch like cruell beaſtes. And of certein, their courage is ſo noble and valiant, &amp; their ſtomacke ſo haughtie, that they contemne Beares &amp; wilde Bores, and vouchſafe to ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onlie Elephantes and Lions. The like whereof, there was one ſent vnto king <hi>Alexander,</hi> and for that he contemned ſuch ſmall game, &amp; his other qualities not being knowen, was therefore not regarded, but, as we read, ſlaine at his commaundement. Then was there afterwardes another ſent vnto him, who proued accordinglie, whom the King loued entierlie, and tooke exceeding delight in him. But touching the loue of dogges towardes men, vnto whom they are reported to be moſt friendlie, yet howe great their loue is in deede, vnleſſe hope of vittailes do get their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, beſides their biting and vnſpeakable barking, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the fable of <hi>Acteon,</hi> but <hi>Euripides</hi> alſo, truelie proueth their tearing and renting of men in pieces. The ſubtiltie of the Fox, among manie other beaſtes, is notable. Certeine fiſhermen, carrying fiſh to the towne, to the market, which in the ſommer time moſt willingly they do by night, vpon a time found a fox lying in the high way, as if ſhe had bene
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:14998:164"/>dead: whom they taking vp, meaning to vncaſe her at their leaſure, to ſaue the ſkin, threwe her vpon their rippes. Then the fox filling her bellie with the fiſhe, ſoddenlie lept away: and ſo to their great wonder &amp; indignation, eſcaped them. Howe manie other ſleightes of Foxes are there? what how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of wolues? what barking about the ſtaules of cattell? what watching of crowes and kites about pigeon houſes, and broodes of chickens? what natural and euerlaſting ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred betweene them, as ſome do report? The one goeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the others neſt, and there breaking the egges, deſtroieth the hope of their broode. As for the Cuckowe, he hath not onlie one or two enimies, but all birdes, in a manner, inſult ouer him, as being a fugitiue, and alwayes complayning. Moreouer, what continuall wayte do the Weeſels lay for the Aſpes to entrap them? what aſſault of theeues is there againſt the priuie chambers and cloſets of rich men? what great watching &amp; warding is there in euerie ſeuerall kinde, howe great and diligent contention? who is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the manifold labours and watchings of hunters, and haukers, their craftes and ginnes to take beaſtes &amp; foules, and of fiſhers, their hookes and nettes to take fiſhes? or on the other ſide the ſubteltie of the wilde beaſtes, foules, and fiſhe? Al which things, what are they other than the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of contention? Moreouer, what ſtinges are there in waſpes and hornettes? and what battailes and conflictes are there betweene theſe plagues and the poore neate? Neither are the dogges, or horſes, or other kindes of foure footed beaſtes at anie more peace and quietneſſe. What troubles haue they with flies in the ſommer time, and howe are they moleſted with ſnowe in the winter, which ſome in ieſt doe terme, the white flies? what continuall vnquietnes is there among rattes, what inſult of fleas by night, what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tention of gnattes by day, what battailes betweene the ſtorckes &amp; the ſnakes and frogges, what warres betweene the Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meis and the Cranes? What ſtrange and wonderfull conflictes doth the greedie thirſt or deſire of golde raiſe vp betweene the people <hi>Arimaspi,</hi> and the Gryphes?
<pb facs="tcp:14998:165"/>So that it is not eaſie to iudge whoſe wickedneſſe is the greater, but that the one endeuour to ſteale, the other to keepe: the one are pricked forth by couetouſneſſe, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by nature. The like deſire to keepe and ſteale, I finde likewiſe in the fartheſt partes of the world among the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians:</hi> whileſt certein <hi>Emotes,</hi> of incredible bigneſſe, and wonderfull crueltie, do ſemblably defende their golde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the like couetouſneſſe of that nation. The Baſiliſke fraieth all other ſerpentes with his hiſsing, driueth them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with his preſence, and killeth them with his looke. The Dragon encloſeth the Elephant within the foldes and windinges of his bodie: for they are doubtfull and vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine. Whereby it commeth to paſſe, that there is naturall enmitie betweene liuing things, as thirſting after warme blood in ſummer, which ſome do write of, and the ende of the battell maketh it credible ynough, if it bee true, that the one doth die drie and without blood, and the other hauing ſucked the blood of his ſlaine enimie, like as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour in the battell, yet being him ſelfe ouercome with his deintie delicates, and burſt in ſunder with ouer much drinking of blood, falleth downe dead in the ſame place. Manie other things likewiſe there be, that doe grieue and offend this kinde of beaſt, as the moſt ſharpe paine after the drinking of an horſleech, and the moſt fearefull ſeeing or hearing of a ſillie mouſe. It is a ſtraunge caſe, that ſo great a beaſt, and of ſo huge ſtrength, ſhould ſo much abhorre the ſight of ſo ſmall an enimie. But thus dame Nature hath created nothing without ſtrife and offence. The Lion him ſelfe, being a couragious and valiant beaſt, and contemning all weapons for the defence of his yong ones, yet dareth not behold the turning, nor heare the ratling of running wheeles, or emptie cartes and wagons: and moreouer, whereat a man may the more wonder, hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide the ſight of the cockes combe, and much leſſe his noyce and crowing, but aboue all things, it is ſaid, that he cannot away with the crackling of flaming fire. This ſtrife therefore hath this beaſt proper vnto him ſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:14998:165"/>hunting, which is common vnto all wilde beaſtes. Tygres alſo haue their contention, who by wit and ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie doe hinder and fruſtrate the pollicies and purpoſes of their enimies that come to ſteale their whelpes, and runne away. As for the ſhee woolues, they be euer at ſtrife with hunger, huſbandemen, and ſhepheardes, I ſpeake nowe of venomous, and wilde beaſtes. But at what quietneſſe are the tame flockes of cattell? with what force, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice doe the hogges contende among themſelues? Howe doe the leaders of the heardes lie togeather by the eares? What bickerments are there betwene them? what flights? what pride is there in the conquerour? what ſorowe in him that is conquered? what remembrance of iniuries? what returne to reuenge? Who marketh not in reading, howe the warlike bulles, &amp; the buck goates that fight with their hornes, haue exerciſed the wittes of the Poetes? What ſhal I ſay of other things? They haue all one cauſe of diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: euerie thing dependeth vpon contention. When was it ſeene, that a ſtrange horſe comming to a newe ſtable, or a ſtrange colte turned into an vnaccuſtomed paſture, could eate his meate in quietneſſe? Who hath not obſerued, that during the time that the henne ſitteth, the heat is great, &amp; the hartburning exceeding in ſo litle a familie? although this alſo be common vnto all foules. There is no liuing creature ſo gentle, whom the loue of his young doeth not exaſperate. The rouſt cockes wounde one another with their ſpurres, and by nature and deſire of blood, plucke eche other by the combe in their fight, with all the force of their bodie: ſo much enuie, ſo much pride reigneth in their hartes, ſuch is their deſire to conquere, ſuch is their ſhame to yeelde. Who ſeeth not the ſtubburneſſe of the Duckes and Geeſe, howe they thruſt eche other with their breſtes, chide their aduerſarie with their gagling, beate him with their winges, and hange together by their billes?

<pb facs="tcp:14998:166"/>The wilde beaſt a wilde beaſt, the foule a foule, the fiſhe a fiſh, and one worme deuoureth another: yea, the lande foules, &amp; foure footed water beaſtes do ſearche, turmoile &amp; ranſacke the ſea, riuers, lakes and flooddes: ſo that of all things the water ſeemeth vnto me to be moſt troubleſome, both in reſpect of it owne mouing, and the continuall tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multes of the inhabitantes thereof, as beeing a thing moſt fruitfull of newe creatures and ſtrange monſters, whereof there is doubt, inſomuch that in this point the learned do not reiect the opinion of the common people, that looke what euer creatures there be vpon the lande or in the aire, the like in forme there are within the waters, foraſmucch as there are innumerable ſortes of ſuch whereof the aire and earth haue not the like: among all which, in a manner, either pray, or hatred breedeth contention. Yea, moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, though theſe ceaſe, yet diſagreement ceaſeth not. For let vs ſee what hartburning there is in loue, what diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in marriage, howe manie complaintes, what ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among louers, what ſighes, what paines, what conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betweene maiſters and ſeruantes, who are nothing the leſſe enimies one to another, for that they are houſholde foes, betwene whom there is neuer anie peace to be hoped for, but that which is procured either by death or pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. I will not ſpeake of contention betweene brethren, whoſe agreement to be verie rare, the trueth it ſelfe witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth by the mouth of that Famous Poet <hi>Ouid:</hi> neither of the diſagreement betweene parentes and their children, whereof the Poeme of the ſame Poet maketh mention: But as touching the loue of parents, whoſe good will is moſt tender towardes their children, yet how great their indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is, it is euident, whileſt they loue them that are good, and lament their caſe, that are euill: and thus in a manner they hate, while they loue hartilie. And as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the moſt neere and deare bande of the name of brother and father, wee ſee it ſometime to bee without loue, and not ſeldome ioyned with hatred. I will come to the holie name of friendſhippe, which being called in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine

Nowe, among friendes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be agreement in the wordes and endes, yet in the way, and in their actes, what diſagreement and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie of opinions and counſels is there? ſo that <hi>Ciceroes</hi> diffinition can ſcarce ſtand vpright. For, admit there be good will and loue betweene friendes, notwithſtanding the conſent of all diuine and humane thinges, wherewith he maketh his diffinition complete, is wanting. What then ſhall a man hope for in hatred? For there is hatred in loue, and warre in peace, and agreement in diſcention, which I will proue to be ſo, by thoſe things which are daily before our eies. Beholde the wilde beaſtes, who being inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the ſword, are tamed by almightie loue. Encline thy minde, and marke with what noyſe and murmure the ſhee Lions, Tygres, and ſhee Beares do come vnto that, which of them ſelues they doe moſt willinglie, and thou wilt thinke that they do it not with deſire, but by compulſion. Some wilde beaſtes, while they engender, do make a great noiſe and ſchritching, and ſome keepe a ſturre with their ſwift and ſharpe talantes. Nowe, if we will giue credit vnto that, which certein great men do write of the nature of the viper, howe much contrarietie is there, how great diſcord, when as the male viper vpon an vnbridled (howbeit natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall) ſweetneſſe &amp; pleaſure, putteth his head into the femal vipers mouth, then ſhe being prouoked with a furious heat of luſt, biteth it of? But when this widowe viper, being by this meanes brought great with young, approcheth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the time of her deliuerie, by the multitude of her heauie yong ones, which nowe make haſte to come foorth, as it were to reuenge their fathers death, is by them torne in pieces. Thus the firſt coupling of theſe two wormes, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well by their generation, as bringing foorth of young, is vnfortunate vnto the whole kinde, and is founde to bee peſtiferous and deadlie: whileſt the engendring ſlayeth the male vipers, and the bringing foorth, the female.

Beholde the neaſtes and houſes of Pigeons, that moſt ſimple birde, and as ſome write, that hath no gall: with what battelles and diſquietneſſe, with what clamour and outcries, I pray you, do they paſſe foorth their life? thou wouldeſt thinke thou were in ſome barbarous and vninſtructed campe, thou ſhalt perceiue them to be ſo vnquiet both day and night: I omitte their inuaſions one of another, yea that verie paire that haue ſeuerally coupled themſelues in the bande of mutuall ſocietie and pleaſure, and for that cauſe are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated vnto <hi>Venus,</hi> with what complaintes are they carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed foorth vnto their deſire? how often doth the cocke goe about the hen? and oftentimes the louer forcibly perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his louer with his winges and bill?

Whereof commeth that ſaying of the Poet <hi>Virgil</hi> in his <hi>Georgikes,</hi> whereat I was wont to meruel, but nowe I wonder nothing at all, howe foules are fraide by noyſe making. For nowe vnto him that ſhall happen to dwell in anie place in the countrie in <hi>Italie,</hi> this one thing is begonne to be one of the manifold ſommer anoyances. For ſo am I my ſelf continually troubled from morning to night with the falling of foules, the ratling of ſtones, and crying out of the huſbandmen. Moreouer, what doeth the mildeawe to the vintage, the blaſt to the herbes, the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker to the leaues, and the moule to the rootes? To be ſhort, the weeuill to the barnes &amp; floores? and the Emot which maketh prouiſion againſt old age come, as the Poet ſaith, what toyle and vnreſt is there in that poore litle creature, that whileſt ſhe prouideth for her owne winter, ſhee trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth our ſommer? I ſhould be verie ſlowe to beleeue other herein, but I my ſelfe know by experience, with how much not only weeriſomneſſe, but loſſe alſo, that duſtie ſwarme, and which by their haſtie marching doe euermore declare their feare, do not onlie ſpoyle and forrey the fieldes, but alſo cheaſtes, chambers, and ſtorehouſes. And therefore I will nowe begin to beleeue, that in the <hi>Piſane</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fines there is a caſtle, which vnto them that ſaile vpon the ſea, ſeemeth to be not farre of, that is become deſolate by meanes of ſwarmes and aboundance of Emotes. The like hereof alſo is reported to haue happened in the <hi>Vincentine</hi> confines. And I am of opinion that it may be true in anie of them both, or in anie other place whatſoeuer: it hath ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a late, that they haue not onelie driuen me out of my countrie houſe, but well nigh out of my houſe in the citie, inſomuch that I was faine to vſe the meane of fire and

And now I verie well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue <hi>Apuleius,</hi> where he ſaith, that there was a man eaten by them, although there want of honie: Neither doe I denie, but that I do wonder, what ſhould be the cauſe, that ſome haue propoſed the Emote to be the patterne of care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe: concerning which matter, ſome haue made long diſcourſes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending their ſparingnes and induſtrie. Wel then, if all carefulnes bee commendable, perhappes this were a meete example for theeues, and not for ſuch as are willing to liue vpon their own, without doing iniurie to an other. It is a carefull creature in deed, no man can denie it, but wicked, but vniuſt, liuing by rapine, induſtrious in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that which is euill, ſeruing to no good vſe, but bringing manifold diſcommodities and weariſomues: why therefore they haue propoſed this example, and why they haue commended this litle beaſt? Againe I ſay, I maruel, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciallie when they might haue vſed the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of the Bee, which is a moſt induſtrious and prouident beaſt, a creature that hurteth none, but is profitable vnto many, ſuccouring it ſelfe &amp; others by it owne natural art, and moſt noble tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell. What ſhould I nowe ſpeake of the hurtful plentie, and ranck increaſe of branches &amp; leaues of trees, againſt which the wakeful huſbandman giueth his diligent attendance, &amp; lieth in waite, being armed with his ſharpe nailes, &amp; the hedge bruſher with his crooked hooke? what of the burres &amp; briars, and the yeerely returne of plants &amp; rootes, which miniſter perpetual matter of ſtrife and toyle? what of the furious rage of ſhewres of raine, and heapes of ſnowe, and biting of froſtes, and the ſharpneſſe and violence of yce, and the ſuddein violence of flooddes, &amp; the vncertein encreaſes of ſtreames, which many times ſhake whole regions &amp; great peoples: but eſpecially the hedges and fences of the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, who among ſo many miſchiefes can ſcarſe paſſe forth this earthlie life, wherein they are euermore bending downe to the ground? And to ſay ſomewhat concerning the diſcommodities and toyles of the delicate &amp; rich ſort: who hath not endured the mightie conflictes of birdes?
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:14998:168"/>Alſo the crying of owles and ſchritches, and the bootleſſe watching of dogges all night barking againſt the Moone, and cattes making their meetings vpon the tyles &amp; toppes of houſes, and the quiet ſilence diſturbed with horrible outcries, and troubling men with their helliſhe clamour, and whatſoeuer elſe maketh anie grieuous noyſe in the darke? Wherevnto may be added, the croaking of frogges and toades in the night, and the lamenting and threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the ſwallowes in the morning: ſo that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would thinke that <hi>Itys</hi> and <hi>Tereus</hi> him ſelfe were preſent. For as touching the quietnes of birdes by day, the ſqueeking graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppers, the arrogant crowes, and braying aſſes doe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe it, and the bleating of cattell, and the bellowing of Oxen, and the vnwitten cackling of hennes without ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſing, who ſell their ſmall egges for a great price. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue al things, is either the crying of ſwine, or the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> clamour and laughter of fooles, than which fooliſh thing, there is nothing more fooliſh, as ſaieth <hi>Catullus:</hi> and the ſinging and merimentes of drunkardes, than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more grieuous: and the complaintes of ſuch as are at variance, and the iangling and ſcoulding of olde wiues: and ſometime the battailles, ſome time the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of children: and of weddings, either their vnquiet feaſtes, or their daunſings: and the merrie mournings of wiues, who by craft do ſeeme to lament the death of their huſbands: and the vnfeigned howlings of parentes at the deceaſe of their children: adde herevnto the thronging and noiſe of the court of iudgement, the altercations of Marchants, and ſuch as buie and ſell, at one ſide the ſmall regard, on the other ſide the oathes of the ſellers. Adioine herevnto the ſorrowful ſinging of the workmen to aſwage their painfull trauel: at the on ſide the vnpleaſant Muſick of ſuch as beate &amp; tooſe wooll, &amp; breake it ſmal with the teeth of the cardes: on the other ſide, the hollowe breathing of the ſmithes bellowes, &amp; the ſharpe ſound of their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mers: whervnto may be added the winter night, which with theſe
<pb facs="tcp:14998:169"/>trauels is deuided into equall partes, ſo that there is no time free from vnquietneſſe &amp; ſtrife. And to touche ſome deale the kinde of things inſenſible, what hath the load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone to do with iron, or the diamond with the loadſtone, the cauſe of whoſe diſagreement, though it be ſecret, yet is their diſagreement manifeſt. For the loadſtone draweth i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, but lay a Diamond by it, and it will leaue to drawe, or let go hold, if it drewe before. The vertue in them both is wonderfull, either in that Nature hath giuen, as it were, hands and hooked nailes vnto an heauie and euilfauoured ſtone againſt a rough and ſtubburne mettal, or whether ſhe take them away vnto her ſelfe by meanes of the other ſtone that lyeth by, which is not the end of the firſt ſtrife, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a newe ſtrife. Howbeit, manie denie this laſt thing to be true, and as for me, hetherto I haue wanted occaſion &amp; will to make experiment or proofe thereof: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I can affirme nothing. But as for the firſt, it is ſo well knowen, that there is no neede to proue or auow it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, hauing vndertaken a great work, with a mightie cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, in to ſhort a time, and to narrowe a ſpace, I doe nowe eaſilie perceiue that I carrie a greater deſire than ſtrength to the accompliſhing therof. Neither were it an eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for me or anie man elſe that ſhould take this matter in hande, ſufficiently to diſcourſe vpon euery point, whereby it may appeare, that al things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſt by diſagreement, which whether they be great or ſmall, are verie wonderfull and ſtrange: although I haue not yet touched that which is greateſt, and to be accompted the moſt maruellous from the higheſt to the loweſt of all Natures miracles: but I will nowe touche it in fewe wordes. The <hi>Echinus,</hi> beeing but a ſmall fiſhe of halfe a foote long, ſtayeth a ſhippe, bee it neuer ſo great, when it is vnder ſayle vppon the Sea, or driuen foorth by oares, being onelie able (of all fiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes) to quaile the force of the elementes and men, by none other meanes than by cleauing to the timber of the ſhippe, by none endeuour or ſtrength in the worlde,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:14998:169"/>but onelie by nature. Which thing, although it be written in the workes of learned and famous authours, yet ſhould it be counted in the number of things incredible, if ſo bee perhaps it were written of the <hi>Indian,</hi> or <hi>Scythian Ocean,</hi> &amp; had not rather happened that in our ſeas this wonder had bin knowen to the Romane Emperours. The cauſe of the ſtay was founde by this meanes, in that when an whole fleete of ſhippes was ſetting forth, one of them ſtoode ſtil, as if ſhe had lien at anker, not ſtirring a whit out of her place. Then ſome that were expert, being lette downe into the ſea, eaſilie perceiued the trueth, and there was founde cleauing faſt to the bottome of the rudder, a litle fiſhe, like a ſnaile, whiche was brought away, and preſented to the prince, who diſdained that ſo little a creature ſhould be of ſo great power, but ſpeciallie wondred at this one thing, that when it was receiued into the ſhippe, it had no longer power to worke that effect, which it did when it cleaued to the outſide. But as touching that other kinde of ſtraunge thing, truelie I had rather keepe ſilence, than abſolutely to auerre it, the fame whereof I knowe not howe true it is, but ſurelie it is newe, and for that cauſe the more to bee doubted of. The thing is this: That about the <hi>Indian</hi> ſea, there is a certeine birde of an incredible bigneſſe, whom our countriemen call a Roche, which is able and accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to take vp, not onelie a man, but alſo an whole ſhippe in her beake, and to flie away with it into the cloudes, and ſo procureth a terrible death to the wretched people han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in the aire. See therefore howe great the force of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe is, which not being able to deter the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers thereof from ſayling, neither by manie other perilles, neither by this moſt cruell daunger, maketh them a pray, that are ſo greedie of pray. And nowe alſo to bring ſome inuiſible things to my purpoſe, in what commixtion of contraries conſiſteth wiſhed temperature, among whiche there is a conioyning of repugnant co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>traries for the brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging foorth of the middle vertue: By meanes of whiche differences, and by what diſagreement of voyces doe men
<pb facs="tcp:14998:170"/>atteine vnto true Muſical concord? Finallie, examine what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer there is, runne through in thy minde al the heauen, the earth, the ſea: there is like contention in the toppe of the ſkie and the bottom of the ſea, and there is ſtrife in the deepe riftes of the earth, aſwell as in the woddes &amp; fieldes, and aſwell is there perpetuall diſagreement in the deſertes of ſandes, as in the ſtreetes of cities. And now leſt through varietie of matter I wander from my purpoſe, I ſay nothing that at the verie beginning of the world, there was a battel fought in the higheſt of heauen, betweene the ethereal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites: and ſome are of opinion alſo, that they fight yet at this day, in this region of the darke and miſtie aire. I ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, howe that in the ſame heauenly conflict, the angels that were vanquiſhed, beeing nowe become inferiour to their conquerours, whileſt they endeuour to be reuenged vpon vs mortall men that inhabite the earth, they haue procured vnto vs an immortall warre of ſundrie temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with an hard and doubtfull buſineſſe. And, that I may gather together into one ſumme, al things whatſoeuer, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſenſe, or without ſenſe, from the vppermoſt toppe of heauen, as I haue ſaid, vnto the lowermoſt centre of the earth, and from the chiefeſt angell, to the baſeſt and leaſt worme, I omitte to ſpeake, howe there is continuall and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting ſtrife betweene them. Man him ſelfe, the lord &amp; gouernour of all liuing creatures, who, onely by the rule of reaſon, ſeemeth able to guide in tranquillitie this courſe of life, and this ſwelling and troubleſome ſea, with what continuall ſtrife is he toſſed, not onelie with other thinges, but alſo with him ſelfe, wherof I will ſpeake anon? But now I will intreat of the firſt: for there is no miſchiefe that one man worketh not againſt another, to admit that all other harmes, by what meanes ſoeuer they happen, whether by nature, or fortune, yet, being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared with theſe, do ſeeme but light diſcommodities. Which, if I would diſcipher at large, which I would not willingly do, and it is far from my purpoſe, both al the whole ſceane of humane actions were to be opened, &amp; al the hiſtorie of life to be peruſed. But it ſhalbe ſufficient for me to ſay thus much: for if there had
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:14998:170"/>ben neuer any other warres in all the world, but the warres of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> there had bin warres &amp; ſtrife ynough. Adde moreouer the diſagrement of opinions, &amp; the indiſſoluble knottes and intrications of matters: who is able to reckon vp the varietie of ſectes, or contention of Philoſophers. The warres of kings &amp; nations are at reſt, but the Philoſophers are not at agreement, and they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tend about a matter, that when it beginneth to be the ones, it ſurceaſſeth to be the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Theſe men contend for the trueth, which euery one of them cannot haue on his ſide, &amp; this ſtrife neither could the maieſtie of the purchaſed veritie, neither <hi>Carneades</hi> the <hi>Academike,</hi> a carefull ſeeker after the Philoſophicall quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, though in vaine, euer be able to appeaſe. Inſomuch that <hi>Anneus Seneca</hi> ſeemeth vnto me, not vnfitly to haue writen, where he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pareth the clocks &amp; dials with Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, for the like diſcord that is found among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Which, howe true it is, whoſoeuer applieth his mind to Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, &amp; his eares to the clocks, may wel perceiue: neither is the doctrine of other Artiſants in more tranquillitie. what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentions are there amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>marians not yet deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>flicts among Rhetoricians? what alterations among Logicians? Finally, what diſcord in all artes? what clamour among Lawiers? who, how wel they agree, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of their cauſes doth ſhew. Of the agrement of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, let their patients be iudge. For, that life which they haue pronounced to bee ſhort, by their contentions they haue made moſt ſhort. Moreouer, what deformitie and what diſagreement of opinions is there in the holie rites of the Church and Religion, not ſo much in the woordes of the learned, as in the weapons of the armed, and more often tried in the fielde, than diſcuſſed in the ſcooles? Thus, being but one trueth, in all matters, vnto which as ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> al things are agreeable: yet the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of them is verie diſſonant &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie, that it troubleth the profeſſours of the truth. What ſhall I ſay of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon life and affaires of men? That there are ſcarce two in a citie that do agree, both manie things elſe, but eſpeciallie the great diuerſitie of their houſes &amp; apparell, doeth declare.
<pb facs="tcp:14998:171"/>For whoſoeuer ſucceeded anie man in an houſe, were hee neuer ſo riche and good an huſband, that hath not neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe chaunged manie things in it? ſo that looke what one man had a deſire to builde, another hath a pleaſure to plucke downe: witneſſe hereof may be, the often changing of windowes, damming vp of doores, and the ſkarres, and newe reparations that are done in olde walles. Neither is this true in other things onelie, but we ſuffer it alſo in our owne, whileſt euerie mans opinion and iudgement is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to him ſelfe, according to the ſaying of <hi>Horace</hi> the Poet, <hi>He plucketh downe, and buildeth vp, and chaungeth that which was ſquare, into rounde.</hi> By which it may more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtlie appeare, which of vs it is than canne agree with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, or with him ſelfe. Now the manner and faſhion of our apparell, continueth three whole daies in our cities: and likewiſe the actes and lawes of certeine Municipies or freedomes haue bene ſuch, and of ſo ſmall continuance, that they haue periſhed with their authours. Againe, what diſagreement and contrarietie is there among Captaines about ordering a battell, and among Magiſtrates for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of lawes, and among ſaylers for counſell, and taking aduiſement? And as for this that I ſpake of laſt, I haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be true manie times to my great daunger, whileſt the ſea and heauen threatning death, the darke night and cloudes ouerſpreding the lande and ſtarres of the ſkie, the ſhip leaking and halfe full of water, the ſaylers in the moſt daunger and middeſt of death, fel moſt obſtinately at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention with contrarie endeuours and opinions. Adde herevnto, the contention which is without an aduerſarie: what battails haue Shriueners with parchment, with inke, with pennes, with paper? what, ſmithes with ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mers, with tonges, with the anduile? what, plowmen with their coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhare, and the cloddes, furrowes, and the oxen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues? what, the ſouldiers, I ſay not with their enimie, but with their owne horſes and armour, when as the horſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell and waxe obſtinate, and their armour troubleth them and wayeth them downe? what buſineſſe haue they that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:14998:171"/>ſpeake, and thoſe that write at the mouth of another, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt earneſt intention conſtraineth the one to ſpeake manie things vnperfect, and on the one ſide ignorance and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkilfulnes, at the other ſide a flitting and vnconſtant wit, alwayes thinking on ſome thing elſe than it hath in hand, hindreth them to conceiue the things that are perfect? But what ſpeake I of euerie ſeuerall thing? There is no handi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſt that is voyd of all difficulties. As for all other, as they haue ſome knowne ſweetneſſe, ſo haue they alſo great ſtore of ſecret bitternes: and of all the thinges that doe delite, there is none without ſtrife. Nowe, what conflictes haue infantes with falles? what contention haue children with their bookes and learning, moſt ſowerly ſowing that, which they ſhall reape moſt ſweetlie? Moreouer, what ſtrife haue yong men with pleaſures? yea, I will ſpeake more tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, what warres haue they with themſelues, and what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is there among their affections? There is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no ſtrife with pleaſures, but a conſent and agreement, which is worſe than any contention. I ſuppoſe and ſpeake vpon experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that there is no kinde of men, nor age that taſteth more ſtrife, or that ſuſtaineth more inextricable &amp; painfull trouble, no kinde of men that ſeeme more merrie, and none in deede more miſerable and ſorowfull. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, in what difficultie and great danger are women in their childe bearing? What contention and wreaſtling haue men continuallie with pouertie and ambition? what great car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for more than is needefull for liuing? And finallie, what euerlaſting warre haue old men with old age &amp; ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes when death draweth nigh, and all other things and perſons with death alſo, and that which is more grieuous than death it ſelfe, with the continuall feare of death? I might dilate this diſcourſe with a thouſand argumentes of ſundrie matters: but if, as it was thy pleaſure in the firſt booke, thou wilt nowe likewiſe haue this epiſtle to ſtande in the ſteade of a preface, &amp; to be part of this booke, I well perceiue nowe how much this preface exceedeth the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the booke: and therefore my curioſitie is to bee
<pb facs="tcp:14998:172"/>bridled, and ſtil to bee ſtayed. And therefore to conclude, all thinges, but ſpecially the whole life of man, is a certeine kinde of contention and ſtrife. But in the meane while, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting this externall ſtrife, wherof we entreated erewhile, which I would God it were leſſe, &amp; therefore leſſe knowne to all men: how great is the internall contention, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt an other, but as I haue ſaide, againſt our owne kinde, not againſt an other particular perſon, but againſt our ſelfe, and that in this bodily outward couering, which is the moſt vile and baſe part of our ſelues? and euerie one hath continuall warre with him ſelfe in the moſt ſecret clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet of his minde. For as touching this our bodie, with how contrarie humours it aboundeth and is troubled, enquire of thoſe that are called naturall Phyloſophers: but with how diuerſe and contrarie affections the minde ſtriueth againſt it ſelfe, let euerie one enquire of none other than him ſelfe, and anſwere him ſelfe, with how variable and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certeine motion of minde hee is drawne ſometime one way, ſome time an other: he is neuer whole, nor neuer one man, but alwayes diſſenting &amp; deuided in himſelfe. For, to ſpeake nothing of other motions, to will, to nill, to loue, to hate, to flatter, to threaten, to mock, to deceiue, to feigne, to ieſt, to weepe, to pitie, to ſpare, to bee angrie, to bee pleaſed, to ſlide, to bee caſt downe, to bee aduanced, to ſtumble, to ſtande vp, to goe forwarde, to turne backe, to begin, to leaue of, to doubt, to erre, to bee deceiued, to be ignorant, to learne, to forget, to remember, to enuie, to contemne, to wonder, to loath, to deſpiſe, and to haue in admiration, and ſuch like, than whiche truly there can bee nothing imagined more vncerteine, and with which the life of man ebbeth and floweth vncerteinly, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the ending without intermisſion. For what tempeſts and madneſſe is there in theſe foure pasſions, to wit, to hope or deſire, and to reioice, to feare and to bee ſorie, whiche trouble the poore and miſerable minde, by driuing him with ſodeine windes and gales, in courſe far from the hauen into the middes of the dangerous rocks? Which paſſions, ſome one way, and ſome another, yea di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:14998:172"/>diuerſe haue expreſſed in leſſe than in an whole verſe. And as Saint Auguſtine writeth, the Poet Virgil hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in a moſt knowne veritie: of which pasſions truly I am not ignorant, that more and leſſe may bee ſaid on both ſides. As for me I haue not much ſtudied for ſhortneſſe nor copie, but I haue ſet downe in writing ſuch matter as in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hath offered it ſelfe to me, out of the common courſe of mans life, that I might not werie the Reader, either with ſcarcitie or tediouſneſſe. And let not the name of Fortune grieue thee, which is repeated not onely in the ſuperſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and tytles, but alſo in the woork: For truly thou haſt often heard mine opinion, concerning fortune. But when I foreſawe that this Doctrine was moſt neceſſarie, ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for ſuch as were not furniſhed with learning, I haue vſed in their behalfe the common and knowne woord, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorant, what other men generally, &amp; moſt briefly. S. Hierome thinketh of this matter, where he ſayth, that there is neither Fortune nor deſtinie, ſo that the common ſort ſhall acknowledge and perceiue here their manner of ſpeaking: as for the learned, which are but ſcarce, they will vnderſtand what I meane, and ſhall not bee troubled with the vſuall woord. Of the one part of this twoofold woorke, concerning pasſions and fortune, wee haue ſaide alredie, what wee thought good, &amp; of the other we will now ſpeake, what wee ſhall ſee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient.</p>

                     </hi> Thus the affaires of men, and thus long continuance and Fortune hath confounded all thinges. I ſay nothing of the kinges of other Nations, and of thoſe, who from the flockes of cattell, and the exerciſe of moſt vile actes, haue ben aduaunced ſode inlie vnto a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. <hi>Alexander</hi> the king of <hi>Macedonie,</hi> made a garde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner a king in <hi>Aſia:</hi> and this was not one of the leaſt commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable actes which he did.

For the more outragious the maiſter is, the more appeareth the ſeruantes patience, and this is the cauſe, that the one of them maketh mention of this matter: but as they muſt ſuffer theyr manners, ſo ought they not alwayes obey theyr commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes.

                  <p>No man can take away the thyngs that are neceſſarie, foraſmuche as nothyng is cruely to be called neceſſarie, without whiche a man may lyue wel. I ſay, lyue wel, not voluptuouſly, not inſolently, or gorgiouſly, but wyſely, but ſoberly, but honeſtly: wherein Fortune, be ſhe neuer ſo proud, ſhal confeſſe that ſhe hath no right. And truely, although deſire of hauing, is not ſatiſfied with al the golde that is in the worlde, and all the pompe of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtones, and plentie of all maner of thinges, notwithſtanding, natural neceſſitie is contented with verie litle, that may be gotten by ſome lyght meanes of the tongue, or exerciſe of the hand: thus vertue is pleaſed with a verie litle, &amp; vice with nothing.</p>

                  <p>Thou muſt get it then ſome where els. Vertue is more liberal then Fortune, for ſhe denieth a man nothyng, but whiche wyll hurt yf it be graunted, and doo good, yf it be forbydden: ſhee taketh away nothyng, but which wyl hurt to haue it, and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to looſe it: ſhee deferreth nothyng, ſhee commaundeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng, ſhee plucketh not backe her hande, ſhee frowneth not, ſhee looketh not ſtrangly, ſhee deſpiſeth no man, ſhe forſaketh no man, ſhee deceyueth no man, ſhee chafeth not, ſhee rageth not, ſhee changeth not, ſhee is alwayes one, and euery where, but that the more ſhe is taſted of, the ſweeter ſhee ſeemeth, and the neerer ſhee is beholden, the fayrer euery day then other ſhee appeareth. That thou mayeſt therefore be ryche in deede, let nothyng carrie thee away from this affliction, or repell thee, although it doo exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and moleſt thee: the fyrſt entraunce vnto it is harde, as for the reſidue, it is redie, pleaſant, and eaſie.

But I knowe what thou wylt ſay: Theſe whom thou haſt named were all of them myghtie Kynges, and my ſtate is farre otherwyſe. Was <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> a King? No, he was not ſo much as a Rych man, in that auncient tyme, when as it was a reproche to be counted ryche, and blynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was ioyned with his pouertie, and olde age with his blynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and yet notwithſtandyng <hi>Tullie</hi> wrytyng of hym, <hi>Foure Sonnes,</hi> ſayeth he, <hi>and fyue Daughters, ſo great an houſe, and ſo great reſort of Suters dyd <hi>Appius</hi> gouerne, beyng both blynd and olde.</hi> Neyther is it marueyle that he gouerned well his priuate affayres, when as, beyng troubled with theſe diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, he gouerned alſo the whole Common wealth. The greater part of humane defectes, conſyſteth in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, not in the thynges. <hi>Appius</hi> eſtate was not lyke a Kyng, neyther dyd he deſyre it, but beyng contented with his owne callyng, decked vp his ſmall houſe not with coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye furniture, but with vertues, and maynteyned his familie with a ſlender dyet. And that whiche many Kinges doo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyllyngly and camplaynyng, that dyd he with an indifferent mynd: For he ſought not for ryches, but conformed his appetite to his abilitie. <hi>Appius</hi> had not the lyke wealth to king <hi>Craeſus,</hi>

Neyther truely doo I require of thee, that thou lyue after any other proportion, for thy ſelfe and thyne, then after thyne owne, nor that thou feede and cloth thy fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie with princely meate and apparrell. Princes chyldren feede dayntily, and are brauely apparrelled: but they lyue not better, nor longer, nor pleaſanter, nor, as it is wel knowen, more ſafely, nor more honeſtly, nor more vertuouſly. In the ſteede of all theſe, they haue one thyng wherein they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, they lyue more pompouſly, that is to ſay, foolyſhlie. Euerie one hath his owne manner of lyuyng and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but not therefore the better, becauſe the greater: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it commeth to paſſe, that oftentymes a man ſhall ſee ſome merrie in a Cottage, and other ſadde in the Court.

With theſe and ſuche other thynges, your Oratour beyng mooued, <hi>There is no ſigne ſo euident of a baſe and vile minde,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>as to loue ryches.</hi> But the <hi>Eccleſiaſtike</hi> Oratour, <hi>There is nothyng,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>more wicked, then a couetous perſon: nothing more vniuſt, then to loue money.</hi> And the aucthoritie of very many that agree in this matter, from whiche there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt none that diſſent, is of ſuche multitude and grauitie, that the common peoples errour ſtriueth to no purpoſe againſt the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the wyſe. And therefore, as there is none more vniuſt,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:14998:194"/>ſo is there no deſyre more ardent then the deſyre of money, as beyng a thyng vpon whiche men are perſwaded that all thinges depende that can be wyſhed for. But contrariwyſe, the voyces of the beſt learned men cry out, experience and trueth crieth out, the multitude of auncient and new examples crieth out, that great maſſes of money are profitable to none, but haue been pernitious to many, are gotten with ſinne and toyle, kept with feare and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and loſt with complaint and heauineſſe. Let the louers of money declare, eyther what falſhood is in theſe woordes, or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in theyr ryches? And to the ende that a thyng ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended may be vprightly conſidered, let euery man cal vnto his remembrance, whatſoeuer he hath ſeene or read perfectly and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely concerning this matter, ſetting apart al regard of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon peoples clamour, and the glittering of the mettalles. And for that all men haue not had the lyke occaſion to ſee and trie, let thoſe thynges be called to mynde whiche are ſet downe in wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng by famous auctours, whiche the learned myght alwayes reade and heare at their pleaſure. And is it not well knowen, that money brought in newe and vnaccuſtomed manners, and that effeminate rycheſſe, by meanes of hatefull riotouſneſſe, dyd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert whoſe ages, that before lyued moſt commendably?

That iron is hurtful, but golde more hurtfull. That the wicked thyrſt of golde d th enforce mens mindes vnto any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, and that the ſpirites are weakened onely with the ſight of money. Is not golde able to paſse through a gariſon of armed men, and to breake ſtones more forcibly then a thunderbolt? and dooeth not hereof ſpryng treaſon, both agaynſt honeſtie and lyfe?</hi> By a golden ſhowre of rayne <hi>Danaès</hi> virginitie was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned, and lykewyſe there was one cauſe of the ouerthrowe of the Greeke Poet <hi>Amphiareus,</hi> and his couetous wife, to wit, the fatall golde, which being wel contemned, by <hi>Argia Eriphila</hi> yll wiſhed for, and yll gotten, brake vp his houſe, and began the occaſion of horrible wickedneſſe. Is it not moſt truely and

And that, <hi>The loue of money encreaſeth, as muche as the money it ſelfe encreaſeth?</hi> And likewyſe this ſaying may be added, <hi>Money maketh no man ryche, but rather contrariwyſe, there is no man in whom it hath not engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred a greater deſire of it.</hi> And no leſſe this, <hi>Care followeth money as it encreaſeth, and greater hunger of it.</hi> And agayne, <hi>To them that aſke many thynges, many thynges are wantyng:</hi> and likewyſe, <hi>They that poſseſse muche, doo lacke muche.</hi> Finally, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they be, they are not permanent and continuyng, as beyng repoſed in the handes of Fortune, ſubiect euermore vnto variable chaunces, and at leaſtwyſe to be loſt by death. For when the ryche man ſleepeth, he ſhall carie nothyng away with hym: yf he open his eyes, he ſhall fynde nothyng, and yet he can not leaue that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng to whom he woulde: for why? <hi>Man paſseth away in an Image, and vaynely troubling hym ſelfe, he heapeth vp ryches toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and knoweth not for whom he ſhall gather them.</hi> Whyle theſe, and a thouſande ſuche lyke ſayinges of wyſe and learned men doo in ſuche ſort ſounde about our eares, notwithſtandyng infinite deſire to haue, hath made you deafe, ſo that the rych men of this worlde are in vayne admoniſhed, not to be too hyghly wyſe nor to truſt in the vncertainetie of ryches, but in the liuing GOD, who geueth all thing plenteouſly, to enioy them to do good, and to become ryche in good woorkes: for they that would be ryche, namely in theſe ryches that are commonly wyſhed for, fall into temptation and ſnares of the Deuyll, and many vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and hurtfull luſtes, that drench men in death and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>For couetouſneſſe is the roote of all miſchieues.</hi> This counſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler wyll they more harken vnto, then they wyll heare hym that ſayeth, <hi>Truſt not in wickedneſse, neyther couet after rapine: yf ryches doo abounde, ſet not thy hart vpon them.</hi> Neither him more then his ſonne, ſaying, <hi>Whoſo truſteth in his ryches, ſhall come to deſtruction.</hi> And agayne, not more then all theſe, hym that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all, whoſe heauenly doctrine can not be contemned but of mad and frantike perſons, who truely calleth ryches, and the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:14998:195"/>companions of ryches, pleaſures, and cares, by the name of thornes, whiche choake the ſeede of holſome woordes: this ſpake he, in whoſe mouth was founde no guyle. The lyuely trueth, I ſay, ſpake this: and dooeſt thou thynke that he founde any fayth vpon the earth? Surely none at all, or but very litle. And that whiche he tearmeth thornes, the worlde calleth chiefe ſweetneſſe and pleaſure. And where as one ſaith, <hi>that pearles and precious ſtones, and vnprofitable gold, are the matter of al miſchiefe,</hi> they thinke them to be the cauſe of al goodneſſe, and doo all auie ſeeke after them as the cheifeſt good, and aboue al other thynges. And now therefore in the ſtreetes of cities and townes, procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is made not mockingly. <hi>O Citizens, citizens, ye muſt firſt ſeeke for money, and for vertue after money.</hi> And this ſaying alſo of another, <hi>Sell thy ſoule for gayne, traffique and peruſe ouer al partes of the worlde.</hi> Thus the great gyft of God, that is not yet vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode, but pouertie that is the great reproche ſent of GOD, commaundeth to do, and to ſuffer whatſoeuer a man luſt. And that is euery day founde true whiche another ſayth, <hi>You ryches, whiche are the moſt vyle thyng of all other, you haue rayſed a contention.</hi> For who is he, I pray you, at this day, that for a rewarde at conuenient oportunitie beyng layde before hym, wyll not violate all equitie, beheade <hi>Polydorus,</hi> and by force enioy his golde? Bryng louyng brethren, or friendly friendes togeather, to an aſſembly, feaſt, or any maner of meetyng, and ſhortly after let diſcorde caſt among them, I ſay not an whole, but a peece of a golden Apple: for with theſe weapons ſhe was woont to trye the quarrell, but now with ſwoordes, ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and triflyng matters are debated. And lyke as there is nothyng gotten with more wickedneſſe then golde, ſo to ſpeake to my purpoſe, there is nothyng loſte with more heauineſſe. For ſynne, whiche is a preſent deſtruction to the ſoule, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, and the next to that, which is loſſe of good name, is not regarded, and loſſe of tyme is eſteemed as a lyght matter. The loſſe of brethren is ſlenderly lamented, of parentes more ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, and of wyues moſte ſlenderly, and many tymes is taken moſt ioyfully: only the loſſe of ryches moſte grieuouſly. And this ſaying is verie true, <hi>Loſt money is bewayled with
<pb facs="tcp:14998:196"/>true teares.</hi> But we haue ſayde muche of that, whereof we can neuer ſay yenough, but neuer a litle, or alwayes to litle is ſayde: for by talkyng with obſtinate myndes, concernyng the loue of money, there is nothyng els purchaſed by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng of them, but hatred and contempt: for whatſoeuer gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayeth the common errours, is reputed madde or counterfeite.</p>

                  <p>I wyll tell thee a ſtorie that is not very olde. There was, not long ſince in <hi>Italie,</hi> a certayne noble and woorthie Gentleman, ryche in auncient poſſeſſions, but rycher in vertues, howbeit not ſo in money, who in ſuch ſort gouerned his money whiche he hadde, as one that had learned to be the Lorde and diſpoſer, not the keeper thereof: he hadde a ſonne, that was his eldeſt, who was very apte and induſtrious in affayres apparteynyng to the iudiciall Court, and ciuile controuerſies, inſomuche that through dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and ſparyng, he hadde gotten togeather great ryches, and an huge maſſe of golde: and it was a ſtrange matter to behold in the auncient father youthly bountifulneſſe, and in the young ſonne aged niggiſhneſſe: His father often times exhorted hym not to defraude him ſelfe of that which was his owne, not to forget to haue regard of godlineſſe, and of his eſtimation, neyther that in reſpect of gold he ſhould be careleſſe of his honour and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie, of his duetie and right, which nature required at his hande: and finally, that he would ſo diſpoſe and conforme him ſelfe, that with his riches he might at laſt helpe him ſelfe, his olde mother, his young brethren and kynſfolke, and the poore, to whiche ende ryches were gotten, and not to be watched and warded, and as it were to be a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual puniſhment to the owners. Thus ſpake his father oftentimes vnto him. But the old prouerbe is true,
<pb facs="tcp:14998:197"/>It is a vayne labour to tell a tale to one that is deafe, or a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous perſon. Nowe it hapned, not long tyme after, that this young man was ſent abrode about affayres of the common wealth, and with certayne ſpeciall and choyce men trauayled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout buſineſſe vnto the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and when he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, his father immediatly takyng the occaſion, makyng new keyes vnto the doores of his chamber and cheaſt, entred in, and tooke away the Treaſure out of that lurkyng Den whereas it lay and profited no body, and very brauely apparelled hym ſelfe therewith, and his wyfe, and his chyldren, and all his familie: He bought hym ſelfe alſo goodly Horſes, Place, and gorgeous houſholde ſtuffe, and laſtly a very fayre houſe and large, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing trim, which he enlarged with new buildinges; and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed it with moſt beautiful pictures, and al other implementes, which a gentlemans eſtate, and a plentiful lyfe required: &amp; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer he gaue much a way to the poore. And as for the bagges in which his ſonnes gold had been, he filled them ful of ſande and grauell of the ryuer, and ſealyng them vp ſafely, leaft them where he found them, and made euery thyng faſt, and ſo departed. All theſe thinges were doone in ſhort tyme, for that the good olde man hadde a willing minde, and the monie alſo was in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe. Nowe when the ſonne was returned home, his brethren went foorth to meete hym: at the ſight of whom he was ſuddeinly amazed, woonderyng at their apparel, and other furniture, whiche was farre altered from that is was woont to be: Wherevppon he demaunded of them where they hadde ſo fayre garmentes, and thoſe goodly Horſes: Who ioyfully, and in chyldyſhe ſimplicitie, anſwered, that al was my Lorde theyr fathers, and that he had many moe fayre Horſes at home in his Stable: And moreouer that theyr father and mother were ſumptuouſly apparrelled, and hadde great ſtore of Princely garmentes. Wherefore he beganne more and more to woonder at euery thyng. From thence proceedyng, when he came within his fathers houſe, he ſcarce knewe his Parentes, nor ſo muche as the very walles of the houſe: whereat beyng not in a ſimple admiration, but rather diſtracted in mynde, and as it were in a traunce, he went
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:14998:197"/>haſtily vnto his Coffer, where when he ſawe nothyng chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vnto outwarde appearaunce, he ſome deale contented his mynde for that preſent. And becauſe that the preſence and haſt whiche his Collegeneſſe made to depart, woulde not permit hym to make farther delay, he ſuddaynely opened his Coffer, wherein beholdyng his bagges faſt ſhutte, and ſtuffed ful as they were woont to be, he forced no more, but ſo departed. Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, when as his publique function was fyniſhed, he came home, and gooyng into his chamber, ſhut the doore vnto him, and opened his Coffer, and ſearched his bagges, and findyng his golde to be turned into ſande, he made a loude outcrie. His father came runnyng haſtily, and, What is the matter, ſonne, quoth he, that thou cryeſt out and weepeſt? O father, ſayth he, I haue loſt my money, whiche with ſo muche watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng, labour, and trauayle, I had gotten togeather and layde vppe in theſe bagges, and I am robbed thereof euen in your houſe. Howe art thou robbed, anſwered his father? Doo I not ſee thy bagges ſtroutyng full? But, O father, ſayde he, weepyng, it is ſande, and not money: and with that he opened the bagges, and ſhewed it vnto his father. Then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the olde man, with a countenance nothyng chaunged, What ſkilleth it, ſonne, to thee, whether they be full of ſande or money? A notable ſaying truely, and proceedyng from a ſingular iudgement: For vnto many, money is vnprofitable and without vſe, and dooeth them none other good, but fylleth a roome, and occupieth theyr myndes, and among moſte men it is wickedly vſed, and but among very fewe employed to good purpoſes.</p>

Moſt vnequal

There be ſome alſo whiche holde opinion, that chaſtitie is the moſt beautifull ornament of this lyfe. Other ſome there be that contemne this in them ſelues, and in others they accounte it ridiculus, or truely very harde, and extreeme paynful: whiche <hi>S.

It is ſtrange, that ſo learned a man ſhoulde be of that opinion: but that he was ſo, it is out of all doubt. There be ſome alſo that count fortitude to be the moſte excellent and ſoueraigne vertue: to receyue woundes with bent breaſt, to ſtayne the fielde with gore blood, and finally, to goe vnto death with a bolde courage. Some there be that aſcribe all theſe thinges vnto extreame mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and iudge nothyng better then quiet and daſtardly idleneſſe.

There be ſome that with great and deſerued commendations doo extoll the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng of fayth and promiſes. There be otherſome alſo that ſay it is no deceipt to breake fayth, but that it proceedeth from more knowledge, and a better wit. Whiche although it be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion and ſaying of the moſt part of men at this preſent,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:14998:215"/>in <hi>Lactantius</hi> it is namely aſcribed vnto <hi>Mercurie,</hi> ſaying, as he reporteth it, <hi>That it is no fraude to deceyue, but craftineſſe:</hi> this is that woorthy god of wyſe dome and eloquence. To be ſhorte, there is no vertue ſo commendable, but it ſhal finde ſome diſprai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers: as for thankefulneſſe, there is no nation ſo barbarus, no manners ſo ſauage, which do not commend it, and no man euer that dyd not diſprayſe vnthankefulneſſe.

                  <p>As for the moſt part there is no loue more tender then the loue of brethren, ſo when it beginneth, there is no hatred more vehement, no enuie more vnquenchable. Thus equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie inciteth and enflameth their mindes, when as the ſhame of geuing place, and the deſyre of ſuperioritie, is by ſo much the more feruent, the more that the remembrance of their infancie togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or what ſo euer els may ſeeme to engender goodwyl, when as they be once digreſſed from the ryght way, may procure ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and diſliking betweene them: in this reſpect therefore, the hart burnyng of a rebellious nature, may be very wel reclaimed, namely by curteſie &amp; gentleneſſe. For there is no nature almoſt ſo rough and vnciuile, whom at length true &amp; continuall humilitie in woordes, and vnfeigned and gentle dealing in al matters, wil not ouercome and molifie. If thou finde this to be voyde and without force, or that peraduenture thou thy ſelfe canſt not enforce thy minde hereunto, whereby he may be honeſtly and profitably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreyned, then before that the matter breake foorth vnto vtter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, thou muſt vſe the laſt and extreame remedie, the roote of the miſcheefe muſt be plucked vp, and comunitie remoued, which is the mother of diſcorde: wherein thou muſt demeane thy ſelfe ſo curteouſly, that looke howe muche thou yeeldeſt of thy right, ſo much thou ſhalt perceiue to be added vnto thy vertue and fame. The ſharpe prickes of impious &amp; proud deſire, are by nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rebated, then by vertuous and curteous liberalitie. That gold is good, whereby the peace of familie, and brotherly loue is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed. It is a very auncient, and no leſſe true ſaying, That theſe two pronownes, myne and thyne, are great cauſe of warres and diſagreement, whiche yf they were taken away from out of the life of man, out of doubt men ſhould liue muche more quietly.</p>

Then he ſyghyng agayne, I had rather, ſayde
<pb facs="tcp:14998:238"/>he, then the one halfe of my landes, that I were as ſure that this boy were myne, as thou art that he is thyne. Whereunto ſhe aunſweared, neyther in countenance nor mynde any whit mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: Truely, ſayde ſhee, the matter ſhall not coſt ſo great a price: but geue me an hundred acres of paſture, whereon I may feede my cattayle, and I my ſelfe wyll reſolue thee in this matter. Then he anſweared, that it was impoſſible. But ſhe ſendyng for ſuch Noble men and Gentlemen as dwelt neere hande, and cauſyng hym to geue his woorde for the perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his promyſe, helde vppe her young ſonne in her armes, and, Is this my chylde in deede, myne ſayde ſhe? And when they all anſweared, yea: ſhe ſtretched foorth her armes, and delyuered hym vnto her huſbande, and heere, ſayde ſhe, take hym, I geue hym thee freely: and nowe be aſſured that he is thyne. Then al that ſtoode by, brake foorth in laughter, and gaue iudgemente on the womans ſyde, and condemned the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande by all theyr verdictes. Such contentions and lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are thereto often among men, they be haſtie to marriage, yea ſlipperie and headlong: you thynke you ſhall neuer ſee the day wherein you ſhalbe huſbandes, that is to ſay, men, as though otherwyſe you ſhoulde neuer be men. Then beyng reſolued in ioyes, or to ſpeake more truely, in madneſſe, the fyrſt dayes of your marriage you ſpende in reuel route, feaſtyng and daunſing, among your weddyng ſolemnities, with paſtimes, and ſonges, and minſtrelles: and the reſidue of your lyfe you ſpende in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition and braulyng.

But if theſe examples doo ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden thee with incomparable holyneſſe, yet is it knowne well yenough that the <hi>Romane</hi> armies, which vanquiſhed the whole world, were for the moſt part of them footemen, who not only carried their armour and weapon on foote, but alſo as muche vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual as ſhould ſerue them many dayes, moreouer a kinde of muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby, when once they were entred within their enimies boundes, they defended their campe in the day times, and theyr tentes in the nyght, agaynſt the inuaſion of their enemies: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon our cuntreiman <hi>Cicero,</hi> in a certein place excellently diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the <hi>Romane</hi> ſouldiers, when he had ſayd that vnto vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant men of other nations theyr armour was no impediment, but in the maner of a garment, yet this commendation he gaue them aboue al other, ſaying, that vnto the <hi>Romane</hi> ſouldiers only their armour &amp; weapons were not a garment, but ſtood them in ſteede of their armes &amp; ſhoulders. And when they had once put on thoſe warlike burdens whereof I ſpake, then they thought them ſelues

And leaſt haply any man be deceiued by the common cuſtome of ſpeache, let it be knowne vnto them, that by the name of ſouldiours or ſeruitours, footemen are only ſignified, and that in many places of the <hi>Romane</hi> hiſtorie it may be geathered, that by this name they are diſtinguiſhed from horſe men, although they doo both ſortes of them ſerue in the warres.

<pb facs="tcp:14998:254"/>are ouerthrowen by iuſtice, ſo are the ryghteous by iniurie. Then, whereas is vniuſt condempnation, there the partie condempned is innocent: and there is no man ſo foolyſh, vnleſſe he were ſtarke mad, that would haue this be contrarie, and had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be condemned iuſtly then vniuſtly.

Whiche is by ſo much the better, by how much oppreſſed iuſtice is better then reigning vngodlineſſe, and a good minde to be preferred before good fortune, although the one abounde with payne, the other with pleaſure: Yea, I wyll ſay more, by ſo much the better it is to be iuſtly condemned, then vniuſtly cleered, as it is woorſe to let a crime eſcape vnpuniſhed, then to punyſh it. For in this there is wickedneſſe ioyned with iuſtice, a great good thing with a great euyl: in the other, wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe matched with impunitie, whiche I knowe not whether it be woorſe then the wickedneſſe it ſelfe, for truely it is the very eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of iuſtice, and the roote of many miſchiefes.</p>

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:14998:258"/>thinke them ſelues ſhacled in moſt ſtreight fetters, whiche effect is not wrought by the beſieging, but by opinion, then whiche there is nothing of greater force in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wauering of this your mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal lyfe. This place requireth that I reſite a fable. It is reported, that at <hi>Aretium</hi> there was of late dayes a very olde man, that neuer had trauayled out of the boundes of his countrey: the fame whereof being brought vnto the eares of the gouernours, for paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſake they called the olde man before them, ſaying that by good proofe they had founde that he vſed ſecretly to depart out of the citie, and to haue priuie conference with theyr enimies. Then beganne he to ſweare by al the ſaintes, that not onely not at that tyme of the warres, but not ſo muche as in the tyme of peace did he euer paſſe without the walles of the citie, from his byrth vnto that preſent houre. But they on the other ſide feigned that they beleeued hym not, ſaying that they muche ſuſpected his fidelitie towardes the common wealth: To be ſhort, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded him vpon a great penaltie not to paſſe out of the citie gates. Howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, they ſay, that he was in ſuche ſort prouoked by the impaciencie of his forbidding, that the very next day folowyng, whiche was neuer ſeene before, he was taken without the walles of the citie. Thus though the pryde &amp; ſtubberneſſe of your mind, ye are alwayes carryed away vnto that whiche is forbidden. And nowe thou complayneſt that thou art ſhut vp, and the whole citie is not bygge enough for thee, whom peraduenture ſome litle corner thereof, perhappes ſome one houſe, might ſuffiſe, yf thou were not beſieged, as for the moſt part it hapneth vnto ſtudentes. Moreouer, it fortuneth that al beſieginges be but of ſhort continuance. Ye haue comfort miniſtred vnto you both by the place and tyme, only ye lacke vprightnes of minde, which cauſeth you to lament and complaine, which runneth not by the nature of the thinges, but through your owne effeminateneſſe.</p>

Where there ſtand now moſt famous Cities, there ſometyme haue ſtoode rough and wilde wooddes,
<pb facs="tcp:14998:264"/>and ſo perhaps ſhall doo agayne.

Therefore the moſt redie and ryght waye to ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and quietneſſe is, not onely not to wyſhe to beare domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as a Tyrant, but alſo not to deſyre to rule as a kyng.

But the familiaritie with the mortall enimie, and the peruerſeneſſe of opinions, doth not permitte to chooſe that whiche is better.

<pb facs="tcp:14998:276"/>the madneſſe of youth on the one ſide, and the impaciencie of olde age on the other, haue in ſuch ſort diſturbed the iudgement of this lyfe, that that is counted good, whiche is euyl, and that moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, whiche is woorſt of al. As for the dayes, they are of them ſelues al good, for aſmuch as the kyng and creatour of al worldes is good.

Of this way then that is beſet with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dangers, and ſubiect to ſo many terrours, what part thereof, I pray thee, can be good?

Thou haſt ſeene welnygh an whole age without any earthquakes, duryng whiche tyme there is no doubt but that there haue dyed innumerable, who in al their lyfe tyme, though they haue hearde the name of ſo terrible a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet neuer were made afearde with the ſight thereof. But who is not mooued when he heareth or reedeth, eyther thoſe auncient hiſtories, or theſe of latter tyme, the memorie whereof is extant, eyther in the bookes of hiſtories, or yet ryfe in the mindes of men that ſawe them, when as long ſence vpon one and the ſelfe ſame day, both the citie of <hi>Rhodes</hi> was ſhaken with an horrible earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, and alſo newe Ilandes roſe vp from the bottom of the ſea, and moreouer twelue auncient cities in <hi>Aſia</hi> were ouerthrowen,

And not long after this, as it were for a continuance of the miſerie, it is wel knowne how that the beſt and moſt fertile part of al <hi>Germany,</hi> namely the whole valley of the <hi>Rhine</hi> was ſhaken, and vpon the ſhoare therof ſtanding the citie of <hi>Baſile,</hi> and alſo caſtles and fortreſſes, to the number of foure ſcore and vpwarde, vtterly ouerthrowen. Truely an horrible matter, were it not that death were the moſt terrible of al terrible thynges. Who ſo hath learned not to feare that, wyll feare nothyng, &amp; as the Poet <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi> ſayeth excellently well, <hi>If al the worlde ſhoulde fall, though the peeces thereof ſtrake hym, he woulde not be a fearde.</hi> For what ſkilleth it whether a litle ſtone fall vpon thee and brayne thee, or the moſt mightie mountayne <hi>Apeninus</hi> cruſhe thee, to death, ſo thou be ſlayne by any of them? or the whole worlde breake and fall vpon thee, ſeeing there is but death in neyther? Vnleſſe perhaps ſome wyl count that death to be the more honorable, whiche is procured by the greater inſtrument. Wherefore to conclude, this is the ſumme of myne aduice, foraſmuch as we haue alſo ſet downe ſome remedies agaynſt lyghtnyng, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſcheefes are releeued eyther by reſiſtyng or geuing place vnto them, and it falleth out contrariwyſe in this, that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther flyght auayleth, neyther wyt nor force can preuayle, it were good aboue al thynges to lay away the feare of death,

                  <p>That the miſerie of mankinde is great and manifolde, I doo not denie, whiche ſome haue bewayled in whole great volumes: but yf thou looke to the contrarie part, thou ſhalt alſo ſee many thinges, whiche make this lyfe happie and pleaſant, although there be none hytherto, ſo farre as I knowe, that hath written of this matter, and ſome that haue taken it in hande, haue geuen it ouer, for that whiles they haue been in the very courſe of their wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, they haue perceyued howe wrong a matche they haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, and that the argument hath fallen out to be muche more barren then they fyrſt ſuppoſed: and the rather, for that the miſerie of mankynde appeareth to be euident, and the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie thereof ſeemeth to be verie ſmall and hydden, ſo that in diſcourſe of diſputation, it requireth a deeper diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and examination, then that the incredulous ſorte are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to conceyue. And nowe out of many matters to gea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:14998:294"/>one ſumme togeather, haue not you great cauſe to reoyce? Fyrſt, for that you are the image and likeneſſe of GOD your Creator, whiche is within in the ſoule of man, your witte, memorie, prouidence, ſpeeche, ſo many inuentions, ſo many artes attendyng vppon this ſoule of yours: and next, howe many neceſſities doo followe this your bodye, whiche all are comprehended vnder the moſt ſingular benefite of GOD: alſo ſo many opportunities, ſo many ſundrie ſhewes and kindes of thynges, whiche by ſtrange and marueylous meanes doo ſerue to your delyght: moreouer, ſo great vertue in rootes, ſo manie iuices of hearbes, ſuche pleaſaunt varietie of ſo many ſortes of flowres, ſo great concorde of ſmelles, and colours, and caſtes, and ſoundes ryſyng of contraries, ſo many lyuyng cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures in the ayre, vppon the lande, and in the ſea, ſeruyng onely to your vſe, and created onely to doo man pleaſure. And vnleſſe you had of your owne accorde voluntarily fallen vnder the yoake of ſinne, you had nowe been gouernours ouer all thynges that are vnder heauen. Adde herevnto moreouer, the proſpect of the Hylles, the openneſſe of the Valleys, the ſhadowie Wooddes, the colde Alpes, the warme Shoars. Adde alſo ſo many holſome Streames of water, ſo many ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurious and ſmookyng Lakes, ſo many cleare and coole Fountaynes, ſo many Seas within and rounde about the earth, ſo many confines and boundes of Kyngdomes, whiche are eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie day changed, and ſome moſt aſſured for theyr immoueable ſtabilitie.

And alſo the moſt glorious and bryght ſpectacle of all, whiche is the circumference of the ſtarrie Firmament, that continually turneth about with

Agayne, the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie of your ſoule, and a way prepared for you vnto heauen, and an ineſtimable merchandize bought for a ſmall pryce, with other matters alſo, whiche of purpoſe I haue deferred to the ende, for that they are ſo great, that of my ſelfe I was not able to comprehende them, but onely through the benefite of fayth: lykewyſe, the hope of ryſyng agayne from death, and takyng vp of this bodye, after that it is rotten and conſumed, to be quickened agayne, and made lyuely, and bryght ſhynyng, and impaſſible with great glorie and maieſtie: and moreouer, that whiche ſurpaſſeth not onely the dignitie of man, but alſo of the Angelles, the nature of man ſo vnited to the nature of GOD, that GOD hymſelfe became man, and beyng made but one perſon, comprehended perfectly in hymſelfe the two natures, and was both GOD and man, to this ende, that beyng made a man, he myght make man a GOD. An vnſpeakable loue and humilitie in GOD, exceedyng felicitie and glorie vnto man, all manner of wayes an hygh and ſecrete miſterie, a woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull and comfortable ſocietie, whiche I knowe not whether any heauenly tongue canne expreſſe, but ſure I am, no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall mouth is able to vtter. Dooeth the ſtate of mankynde ſeeme vnto thee by this meanes but ſmally aduaunced, and the miſerie thereof but a lytle relieued? Or what, I pray thee, coulde man, I ſay not hope, but wyſhe or imagine bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:14998:295"/>for his owne commoditie, then to be made GOD? And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde he is GOD. What remayneth there more that you myght wyſhe for, or deſyre, or inuent, or thinke vppon yet grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then you haue alredie obteyned?

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, concernyng the baſeneſſe of thy byrth, or deformitie of thy bodye, whatſoeuer is amplified vppon that ground by the witte and inuention of any, when as the generall reſurrection
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:14998:295"/>ſhall come, whiche men of vpryght fayth doo vndoubtedly looke for, ſhall not onely be taken away, by the woorthyneſſe of the gloryfying of the bodyes, but alſo be diminiſhed by the preſent beautie, and the ſinguler Maieſtie wherewith GOD hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued man, aboue all the woorkes of his handes: For, wherein can the baſeneſſe of byrth diſparage the dignitie of man? Doo not tal and ſpreadyng Trees whiche growe vppon filthy rootes, couer the greene fieldes with their pleaſaunt ſhadowe? Doo not the rankeſt Corne ſpryng from moſt filthie dunge? and yet ſo vile an encreaſe of ſo excellent a thyng is not contemned? You are the corne of GOD, that muſt be clenſed vppon the floore of his iudgement, and be layde vp in the barne of the great Maiſter of the houſholde, although your originall come from the earth, and in ſome part it be excellent, and of an heauenly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but let it be what euer it wyll, and be the encreaſe neuer ſo difficult, yet the laſt reſtyng place thereof is Heauen. What ſhall we ſay vnto the nakedneſſe and imbecilitie of the bodye, and the pynchyng want of many thynges, whiche are aſcribed vnto the reproche of mans eſtate? Are they not ſupplyed by the aſſiſtaunce of ſundrie artes, and manifolde prouiſions, ſo that they may be rather applyed vnto the glorie of man, then to his miſerie? Whiche appeareth to be true, in that dame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath prouided for all other lyuyng creatures that want the vſe of Reaſon, a thycke hyde, clawes, and hayre to couer them withall: but vnto man, ſhe hath geuen onely vnderſtandyng, to be a meane to fynde out all other thynges withall, to the ende that the bruite beaſtes myght be in ſafetie, by meanes of an outwarde defence, but man by his owne inwarde purueyance: and the fyrſt ſhoulde haue as muche as was borne with them, and no more, but man, as muche as he coulde by experience of lyuyng and meditatyng with hym ſelfe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe by his witte. In lyke manner, yf a Maiſter geue any vaintie meate vnto his Seruantes and Hindes, he deuideth vnto euery one his portion by hym ſelfe, but vnto his wyfe and chylde he geueth none, ſo that the Seruauntes muſt haue no more then that whiche was geuen them, but the other may take as much as they lyſt: thus is the one ſort ſtinted, and the other
<pb facs="tcp:14998:296"/>are at theyr libertie. Thus then, when theſe other creatures waxe bald, eyther by meanes of olde age, or mangineſſe, or haue ſore eyes, or fall lame, we ſee they haue none other remedie, but that which is mniſtred vnto them by men: but man, beyng of himſelfe naked, is clothed and beautified, and yf neede require, is alſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with his witte: and yf he chaunce to fall lame, or be weake, then he rideth vppon an Horſe, or ſayleth in a Shyp, or is carried in a Couche, or leaueth vpon a Staffe: To be ſhort, he aſſayeth all meanes to helpe and eaſe hym ſelfe, yea though he haue loſt ſome lym, he practiſeth to make him ſelfe legges of Wood, handes of Iron, noſe of Waxe, and prouiding againſt all miſhaps, yf he waxe ſicke, he helpeth hym ſelfe with medicines, and with diuers ſauces he quickneth his dull taſte, with medicines for the eyes he cleareth the dulneſſe of theyr ſyght, in whiche thyng ye haue deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed more wyſely then dyd your forefathers, who, <hi>Anneus Seneca</hi> writeth, vſed to occupy veſſels of Glaſſe full of water, whiche is a game very delectable vnto nature, who is a pleaſaunt and ſweete mother, in that ſhe reſtoreth that vnto her chylde, whiche ſhe tooke from hym, and when ſhe hath made hym ſorie, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth hym agayne. Yea, ouer and aboue this, the Horſe, the Oxe, the Elephant, the Camel, the Lion, the Tyger, the Parde, and all other beaſtes, of what ſtrength ſo euer they be, when they are once olde, are no longer regarded, and when they be dead, they are no more hearde of, they yeelde vnto olde age, and geue place vnto death: onely vertue, whiche is proper vnto man alone, maketh hym that is indued therewith, honourable in his olde age, and gloryous at his death, and not beyng able to extynguyſhe hym, tranſporteth hym ouer vnto felicitie. To be ſhort, there are ſome lyuyng creatures ſtronger then man, ſome ſwyfter, ſome quicker of ſenſe, none more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in dignitie, none in lyke ſorte regarded of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. Vnto the head he hath geuen a <hi>Sphericall</hi> figure, and as it were the forme of a Starre. And whereas all other ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng creatures looke downe towardes the grounde, he made man to turne his face vpwardes, and to behold the heauens, and to lyft his countenance towardes the ſtarres, as it is notably ſayd of <hi>Ouid.</hi> although it were ſpoken before by <hi>Tully, <hi>He gaue hym
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:14998:296"/>eyes, he made hym a foreheade, in the whiche the ſecretes of the minde ſhoulde ſhyne, he hath geuen alſo reaſon, and speache, he hath geuen weeping, he hath geuen laughing, whiche are ſignifications of ſecrete and hidde affections, although ſome doo drawe them to an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of miſerie, becauſe haſtie weeping, is late laughing.</hi>
                     </hi> For as ſoone as he is borne, he weepeth by and by, and laugheth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fourtie dayes are expired: that thing eſpecially this wiſe cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature doth proue, which is ſkylful of thynges to come, not the end, whiche I accompt happie through the gouernance of vertue, but rather difficult, for that he is entred into trauel and the garboyle of preſent paynes. To conclude, whatſoeuer ſtrength is in all other creatures, whatſoeuer ſwiftneſſe, whatſoeuer oportunitie, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer commoditie, it wholly ſerueth to the vſe of man. He bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the wilde headed Oxen to the yoke, &amp; forceth the fierce Horſe to be bridled. The Beares, that are to be feared for their clawes, Boares for their tuſkes, and Hartes for their hornes, he hath made them to garnyſhe mans Table. The Linx, the Foxe, and an infinite number moe creatures of that ſort, becauſe they were not to be eaten, he hath reſerued for the vſe of their ſkins and hide. He ſearcheth the ſeas with nettes, the wooddes with Dogges, and the ſkies with foules, and with whom hath man nothing to doo? He hath taught ſuch beaſtes to vnderſtand mans voyce, &amp; to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient vnto hym. Thus of euery naturall thyng, there is ſome commodity gotten. Thou haſt not the ſtrength of an Oxe, yet thou makeſt hym to drawe. Thou haſt not the ſwyftneſſe of an Horſe, and yet thou makeſt hym runne. Thou canſt not flye ſo well as a Goſehauke, and yet thou makeſt hym flye for thee. Thou art not ſo bygge as an Elephant or a Camell, yet thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt the one of them to beare a Turret, and the other a burden. Thou haſt not the ſkynne of a Bucke, nor the pelt of a Lambe, nor the caſe of a Foxe, yet theſe haue them for thee. Is this anſweare then of a certayne <hi>Romane</hi> Captaine, improper vnto them that ſay you are deſtitute of theſe thynges, to witte, That a man would not haue theſe thinges, but had rather gouerne them that haue them? And thus muche haue I ſpoken breefely, partly like a Philoſopher, and partly like a Catholike. Touching the greefe of the minde, for ſo the Philoſophers doo tearme it,
<pb facs="tcp:14998:297"/>the better to expell it, and purchaſe tranquilitie thereunto, it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayleth to knowe what <hi>Tullie</hi> hath diſputed of the fyrſt, in his diſputations vppon the thyrde daye in his <hi>Tuſculans:</hi> and of the ſeconde, <hi>Seneca</hi> in his booke whiche he wrote, of the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilitie of the minde. For whileſt I make haſte vnto other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and drawe towardes an ende, I ſhall not haue tyme to comprehende all thynges that I woulde: For the preſent, it is ſufficient that I haue bounde vp the wounde, and ſhewed thee the Phiſitions of the minde, whoſe helpe thou mayeſt vſe, yf theſe thynges be not ſufficient. Nowe as touchyng thoſe three thynges, whereof thou complaynedſt laſte, I haue not thought them woorthie the anſwearyng, for as muche as of the roughneſſe of Fortune, wherein the greater part of this our ſeconde booke of talke hath been, and ſhal be ſpent, both the very ſhortneſſe thereof ought to mollifie and diminiſhe the ſharpeneſſe it ſelfe, and nature alſo doth appoynt an vncertayne ende of lyfe, that it may ſeeme alwayes to be at hande, or not verie farre of.</p>

If thou doubt of this, aſke of the princes of both eloquence: for as touchyng the briefer ſort of Oratours, al hiſtories are full that for this cauſe they haue peryſhed in euery place: Among whom he is moſt neareſt vnto danger, that is moſt excellent of fame, and beſt knowen. There are ſome vnto whom the obſcureneſſe of their name, hath been the caſtle of their defence. But admit that they whiche are eloquent be out of danger, yet neuer want they trauayle. In al the worlde there is nothing ſo vayne, for whiche ſo many labours, ſo long watchynges are willyngly vndertaken: this flickering breath ſo exerciſeth mens mindes, as though there were ſome vertue in their wordes.</p>

Geue thy mind ſpace to refreſh it ſelfe, and to ſhewe foorth it owne ſtrength in the preſent danger, and then ſhall it receiue the aſſault of the enimie with ſecuritie.

<pb facs="tcp:14998:320"/>to vanquiſhe the caſtle of their minde, that it is an hard matter for it to keepe vpright iudgement. For ſometime there commeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it a certaine dulneſſe, and ſometime a doubting whether thoſe thynges be true or not, which are commonly reported by men of great learnyng and holyneſſe, concerning the vertue of patience, of the cumlineſſe of honeſtie, and the bryghtneſſe of glorie, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that whiche is diſputed by others, and liked of the common people: to witte, that the beſt thyng that can be, is to be out of payne, that there is nothing woorſe then payne, and that pleaſure is the ende of all, whatſoeuer is good: alſo, that as for the fyrſt, they are the ſayinges but of fewe, but theſe the ſpeeches welnigh of al men, whereof ſome tymes the noyſe is ſo great, that theſe fewe voyces of thoſe that doo exhort, can not be heard, and the keepers of the Caſtles beyng made afearde, forſake their charge, and prouide for them ſelues by flyght. In this caſe, the minde whiche is doubtful and vncertaine to whiche ſyde to turne, ought to be reſcued with a freſhe force, that it fall not from it auncient perſwaſion, as ſometime dyd <hi>Dioniſius Heracleontes,</hi> who when on a time being ouercome with payne, he had reiected y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of his Schoolemaiſter <hi>Zeno,</hi> concerning payne, he deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be mocked of his Schoolefellow <hi>Cleantes</hi> Let him not, I ſay, forget, but reſiſt, and keepe his feete within the ſteppes which he hath poſſeſſed, vnderſtanding what is a true thing in deede, and what ſhadowed: neither let him be afearde of Bugges, nor moued at outcries, aſſuring him ſelfe, that payne is nothing but daſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, which daſtardlineſſe, as alſo paine, &amp; death, and al difficult thinges may be ouercome by vertue. In this opinion let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue fixed and vnmoueable, being redy valiantly to ſuffer that for vertue ſake, whiche is terrible vnto many to thynke vpon, which could neuer be doone by any man that had not loued the moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler beautie of vertue, aboue the glittering of golde and precious ſtones, aboue the gleming of womens faces, or any other thyng that may be deſired. By this confirmation of the minde, both falſe opinions, and needleſſe feare is weakened, and the ſharpneſſe of payne aſwaged. And many tymes that commeth to paſſe, wherof <hi>Cicero</hi> ſpeaketh, that lyke as in battayle the Souldiour that is afearde, and throweth his weapon from hym, when he ſeeth his

Verily, then ſuche kinde of talke whereof I ſpeake, there is none more effectuall, eyther to the obſeruyng of comlyneſſe, or enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the ſtrength to the enſuing of thoſe thyngs, wherof we haue entreated, or to the brynging of our purpoſe to a wyſhed ende.

Be of good comfort, I pray thee, and doo not faint, neyther be angrie, nor afearde: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this be paynefull for a tyme, it ſhall not continue long, but be profitable, doubt not, for our euerlaſtyng ſaluation, and this puniſhment be more greeuous vnto hym that commaunded it, then to thee that ſuffereſt it. Lift vp thy ſelfe, O ſoule, and abandon al feare, put thy truſt in GOD, &amp; anon al ſhalbe at an ende. By which woordes, how great a boldneſſe he gathered to hym ſelfe, and engendred the lyke within the hartes of the hearers, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible to be ſpoken: how great courage with compaſſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, ſecuritie, patience he procured to hymſelfe and others. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, if it were diligently examined, this whereof we ſpeake, is no inward, but an outward ſpeeche, for that, as I haue ſaid, it was outwardly heard of many, yet this and ſuch lyke woordes may be ſpoken by other in ſilence, &amp; perhaps were ſpoken ſo by him alſo, for ſomtime he held his peace, &amp; ſomtime he brake foorth into theſe wordes which I haue recited. Moreouer, this inward ſpeech may be vnderſtoode another way: when as a man regardeth from whence it commeth, &amp; not whither it is heard, as I ſuppoſe it veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in this man, when he ſpake with him ſelfe: but of one that in his paynes and dangers commoneth with God, there is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample more notable, then firſt of <hi>Iob,</hi> &amp; ſecondly of <hi>Theodoſius:</hi> The one being ſtrooken by the hand of God, and full of botches,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:14998:321"/>with what after a manner chiding libertie doth he cal vpon God, and erect hym ſelfe vnto hym with a feruent and complayning deuotion?

And that thou mayeſt not cal this manner of ſpeeche eyther a poetical colour, and a Philoſophical quirke, Ieſus Chryſt the truth it ſelfe called the death of his freend, a ſleepe: and art thou afeard to do that once, wherin thou takeſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure euerie day?

                  <p>Nay rather it remayneth: for if it were once gonne, it would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne agayne: and moreouer there is a certayne feare of death naturally ingraffed within the hartes of the common multitude. But it is a ſhame for a learned man to haue the feelyng but of the vulgare ſort, whom it becommeth, as I ſayd erewhyle, not to folowe the ſteppes of the greater part, but of a fewe. And concernyng that whiche thou ſpeakeſt of Philoſophers, I muche merueyle, that ſince you learne the preceptes of ſaylyng of ſaylers, and of huſbandrie of huſbandmen, and alſo of warfare of warriours, ye refuſe to take aduice how to direct your
<pb facs="tcp:14998:325"/>lyfe of the Philoſophers? And ſeeing you aſke counſel of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitious for the cure of your bodyes, why do you not reſort alſo to Philoſophers for the ſaluing of your mindes, who if they be true Philoſophers in deede, they are both Phiſitions of your mindes, and the inſtructours of this lyfe? But yf they be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeites, and puffed vp onely with the bare name of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, they are not only not to be ſought vnto for counſel, but to be auayded, then whom there is nothing more importunate, nothing more abſurde: of whom this age is muche more ful then I coulde wyſhe, and much more deſtitute of men, then I woulde it were. And therefore, ſeeing there is nothing els to be expected at the handes of them that are nowe preſent, but meare toyes and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles: yet yf there be any thyng alleaged by them, whiche eyther they haue founde out them ſelues, or borowed of the auncient wryters, that may aſwage thy greefe, do not reiect it, nor ſay as do the vnlearned, this thou haddeſt out of the Philoſophers. For then wyl I anſwere thee with <hi>Cicero: <hi>I thought thou wouldeſt haue ſayde, of whores and bawdes.</hi>
                     </hi> And to ſay the trueth, where ſhoulde a man fiſhe or hunt, but where fiſhes and wylde beaſtes are, in the waters and wooddes? Where is golde to be digged, or precious ſtones to be gathered, but where they growe? For they are to be founde in the veines of the earth, and vpon the ſhoares of the ſea. Where are marchandizes to be had, but of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantes? Where pictures and images, but of paynters and ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers? And laſt of al, where wylt thou expect Philoſophical ſawes, but at the Philoſophers handes? Whiche, although they lye hyd vp by them in their treaſuries and were firſt founde out by them, neuertheleſſe the ſame are ſet open and expounded by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that paraduenture more playnely, or more pithily, or more breefely: or laſtly diſpoſed in ſome other order and methode promiſing lyke hope vnto al that heare them, but bringing ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe vnto fewe. For ſuch is the force of order and good ioyning, as <hi>Horace</hi> very wel declareth in his Poeticalles, that one matter being diuerſly told repreſenteth a greater grace vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mind of the hearer, yea though it be a common thing that is told, ſuch nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie may be added vnto that which is old, and ſuch light vnto that whiche is euident, and ſuche beawtie vnto that whiche is fayre:

                  <p>The dread thereof is ſpecially engendred by the lacke of meditating thereon, and the ſudden neceſſitie of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whiche in a learned and wyſe man is moſt ſhameful, but ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in an olde man, whoſe whole courſe and order of lyfe, yf he be learned and wyſe indeede, ought to be a continuall meditation of death, Whiche if it ſeemed ſo vnto the auntient Philoſophie, what may it nowe appeare vnto your new deuotion, which is the hygh Philoſophie, and the true wiſedome? Conſider the maner of them that are commaunded vpon a ſudden to goe ſome far iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, how ſadde and careful they are to make vp their carriage, and how they complaine at their departure, and in a maner, repine that they had no longer warning before: ſo that as ſoone as their backes are turned, they thinke vpon neceſſaries, which they haue forgotten, and are diſcontented therewith. Now, there is no way longer, then to dye, none harder as they ſay, none more noyſome for Theeues, none more obſcure, none more ſuſpicious, nor more vncertaine, which though it wanted al theſe, yet is it vnreturneable. By meanes whereof ye ought to be the more diligent, leaſt haply ye forgette any thing, for that when ye are once departed from hence, ye can no longer doo as they that occupie other trades, or vndertake whatſoeuer other iourney, that is to ſay, commit ſuche thynges by their letters or meſſengers vnto their freendes to ſee vnto, as they them ſelues haue left forgotten. For ye are not able to ſende any meſſage backe, nor to ſtay in the place where ye were, nor to returne agayne. Ye muſt needes goe hence, it is not poſſible for you to returne: ye muſt needes goe thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Souldiers, from whence it is not needefull that ye come backe agayne. Thus in <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayde the Romane
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:14998:326"/>Captayne to his men, and thus alſo ſayth your Captayne to you. And therefore ſeeyng ye muſt needes depart and come no more, and that the neceſſitie of your iourney is very certayne, but the houre of death vncertayne, this is your onely remedie, to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes readie in mind, to anſwere when ye are called, and to obey when ye are commaunded, and when all thinges are diſpoſed in good order, at your Captaines fyrſt commaundement, to goe foorth on you iourney couragiouſly, which ye muſt needes take in hand eyther willingly, or in ſpite of your beardes. This mee thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, ſhould very muche abate your feare and payne of death, and make you not onely careleſſe, but alſo deſyrous to depart hence. Otherwyſe, yf ye be vnprouided and take no regarde, the ſame may befall vnto you, whiche <hi>Cicero</hi> once truely in his Epiſtles prophecied vnto his freende <hi>Brutus: <hi>Ye ſhalbe ſuddenly oppreſsed, beleeue me freende</hi> Brutus,</hi> quoth he, <hi>vnleſse ye foreſee and make prouiſion.</hi> And ſo truely it hapneth in deede, I ſay, vnto all that vſe no forecaſt in that which is lyke to happen vnto them hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

Howe many are there whiche with greefe doo heare that name, whiche ought alwayes to beate vppon the inner eare? Without the whiche, there is no man that can thinke vppon him ſelfe: for what ſhould he thinke him ſelfe to be other then a mortal creature? As often as a man turneth backe into the conſideration of him ſelfe, doth not the name of death preſently come into his minde?

For euery thing that is vnthought on &amp; ſudden, ſhaketh the ſoule. It is as much follie to couet a thing in vaine, as to be deſirous to auoyde that which thou canſt not, &amp; they are both of them the more fooliſh, by how much it had ben the more hurtful that thou haddeſt obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that, which thou deſireſt. But there is nothing more hurtful amongſt al the miſchiefes of this worlde, then to forget GOD, a mans owne ſelfe, and death, which three thynges are ſo vnited and knytte together, that they may hardly be plucked aſunder: but ye wyll ſeeme to be mindfull of your ſelues, and vnmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full both of your begynnyng and ending. Thou mayeſt marke them, that vpon ſome occaſion ſet all thinges in order in theyr houſes, howe there is ſcarce any that dare ſay, when I am dead, but yf I dye, as though that were in doubt, then the which there is nothyng more certayne. Neyther is this ſaying, If I dye, plainely pronounced, but rather yf any thyng happen vnto me otherwyſe then well: whiche what I pray thee can it other be, then the ſelfe ſame thyng that hath hapned vnto all men, or ſhall happen both vnto them that are nowe alyue, or that ſhall be borne
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:14998:327"/>hereafter? Vnto whom as there hath hapned ſundrie kindes of lyfe, ſo ſhall there lykwyſe befall diuers kindes of death, but one neceſſitie of dying. The ſame doeſt thou couet to eſcape, whiche neyther thy Fathers, neyther the Kinges of nations coulde euer eſcape, nor euer ſhal. Deceiue your ſelues as much as ye lyſt, euen ſo ſhall it happen vnto you, as it doth vnto them that winke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtroke of their enimies weapon, as though they ſhould not feele the danger which they ſee not: ye ſhal be ſtroken, ye ſhal dye, ye ſhall feele it: but whether it ſhal happen vnto you eyther blinde, or ſeeing, it lyeth in your handes. Therefore deſire to dye well, which thing alſo, vnleſſe ye doo lyue well, is in vaine. Wyſh therefore, I ſay, and endeuour your ſelues, and doo what lyeth in you: commit that whiche remayneth vnto him, who vnto thoſe whom he brought into this lyfe of his owne accorde, not being therevnto required, wyll not ſtretch foorth his handes when they depart out of it agayne, vnleſſe he be called on and deſyred. Wyſhe not, not to dye: for it is not onely an impudent and an arrogant, but alſo an vnfruitfull and a vayne deſyre. Accuſtome your ſelues, O ye mortall men, vnto the lawes of nature, and yeelde your neckes to that yoke which can not be auoyded.

What is the thyng that troubleth thee ſo muche, that nothyng can helpe thee but death only? Is it thine owne, or thy freendes, or perhaps the aduerſitie of thine afflicted countrye? As for the firſt two, they are but gentle: for fortune is not ſo ſtrong, but ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is able to withſtand it the thirde is godly, but the loue thereof is fainte and ſlouthful. For the bondage and captiuitie of a mans countrey, and the gouernement thereof in manner of a Tiran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, is rather to be repelled by death, then auoyded by ſteppyng a ſide. For the firſt is the part of a man, but this taſteſt of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manyſhe imbecillitie. Whiche thyng notwithſtandyng the ſame <hi>Seneca</hi> doth woonderfully extol in the death of <hi>Cato</hi> in that ſame his peculiar opinion, whereof I ſpake erewhyle. But <hi>Cicero</hi> thinkyng it ſufficient to excuſe him only, abſtaineth from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending him.

Whiche how wel or ill it was done, I do not now diſpute. But ſo in deede he did. As for <hi>Cicero,</hi> whyle he excuſeth <hi>Cato,</hi> he forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his owne more commendable opinion, whiche long before he had ſet downe in his ſixth booke <hi>De republica,</hi> of a common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
<pb facs="tcp:14998:330"/>whiche is after this manner folowyng: whiles that he bringeth in <hi>Publius Scipio Affricanus</hi> the younger drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, howe that he talked in heauen with his father and graund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, and hearyng them ſpeake of the immortalitie of the ſoule, and the felicitie of the other lyfe, made hym deſirous to dye, and brought in his father by and by reprouing the ſame his fonde and vnprofitable deſyre, in theſe woordes. <hi>It may not be ſo,</hi> quoth he: <hi>for vnleſſe God, whoſe churche al this is which thou beholdeſt, doo looſe thee out of theſe bondes of thy bodye, thou canſt haue none entrance hyther. For men were created for this cauſe, that they ſhoulde beholde the globe whiche thou ſeeſt in the middeſt of this temple, whiche is called the earth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, good ſonne <hi>Publius,</hi> both thou, and alſo al vertuous men, ought to keepe your ſelues within the cuſtodie of this your bodye, and not to depart out of the lyfe of man contrarie vnto his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, by whom that lyfe was geuen vnto you, leaſt happely ye ſeeme to forſake the vocation whereunto God hath called you.</hi> Doo not theſe woordes of <hi>Cicero</hi> ſufficiently reprooue <hi>Cato.</hi> that is excuſed? And truely, yf thou were appoynted by ſome earthly Prynce or Captayne to keepe a place by defence of armes, thou wouldeſt not dare to depart from thy charge without his lycence, whiche yf thou ſhouldeſt doo, doubtleſſe he woulde take it in ill part. Howe then woulde the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Emperour take it, thynkeſt thou, vnto whom ſo muche the more obedience ought to be geuen, by howe muche God is greater then man? There was of late dayes one <hi>Stephanus Columnenſis,</hi> a gentleman of auncient vertue, who yf lie had lyued had not onely been famous in this age, but alſo in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of al poſteritie. The ſame <hi>Stephanus</hi> beyng beſieged by a mightie enimie of his, vnto whom he was in power far vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, committed the defence of one turret, wherein there ſeemed to be moſt danger, vnto one of his captaynes, of whoſe truſt he was aſſured. This turret being vndermined and ſecretly ſhaken by the enimies, ſo that it was in danger of fallyng, when as the reſidue of the gariſon perceyuing ſo much forſooke it, and perſwaded hym alſo to come downe and prouide for his ſafety, ſince it was boote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to tarrie, but vnto him ſelfe very dangerous or rather preſent
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:14998:330"/>death: I wyl not come downe, (ſayde he) vnleſſe he cal me away who ſet me here. Which being reported vnto <hi>Stephanus,</hi> who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo was very careful for the gentleman, &amp; came running in baſt to cal hym away, the turret beyng ſhaken at the very foundation, fel downe immediatly with great noyſe. Thus that truſtie defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant was miſerably ſlayne, whom his lord and maiſter beyng ſcarcely able to finde out among the rubbiſhe and ruynes of the turret, buryed hym with great ſorowe and lamentation, and whyle he lyued had a dutiful care ouer hym, and in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſpeeche alwayes aduaunced his fayth with worthy commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.

Among whom <hi>Sainct Auguſtine,</hi> a moſt ſharpe ſearcher after the truth, diſputeth, that this was not the cauſe of the haſtenyng of his owne death becauſe he woulde not lyne vnder the empire of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> togeather with his ſonne: foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as he hym ſelfe was the cauſe that his ſonne fledde to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and in hope of ſafetie ſubmitted hymſelfe to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, wherein he was not deceyued. Whiche yf he had thought to
<pb facs="tcp:14998:331"/>haue been a ſhameful thyng, would he not haue delyuered his ſonne from it as wel as hym ſelfe, eyther by poyſon, or by ſword, or by ſome other kynde of death whatſoeuer? Seeing that <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Torquatus</hi> is commended for killyng his owne ſonne, for that he had geuen battel to his enimies and vanquiſhed them, but contrarie to his fathers commaundement. Neyther can it be ſayde, that it is a more ſhameful thing to be conquerour ouer a proude enimie, then to be ſubiect to an arrogant conquerour. Why then dyd he thinke <hi>Caeſar</hi> woorthy to graunt lyfe to his ſonne, who thought hym vnworthie and enuied at hym that he ſhould graunt lyfe vnto hymſelfe? And to conclude, he findeth that only enuie was the cauſe of his death, whiche <hi>Caeſar</hi> hym ſelfe did not diſſemble, as we ſayde erewhyle. For what coulde he other feare, or why could he not abyde hym to be his prince, by whom not long before he was banyſhed the ſenate, and committed to pryſon? So that he that ſlue not hym ſelfe in ſo great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent an iniurie, why ſhoulde he nowe ſlaye hym ſelfe for a vayne feare, or falſe opinion of pryde, or crueltie? What ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror was there expreſſed in <hi>Caeſars</hi> face, that he ſhoulde ſeeke to auoyde the ſame by death, who not only of all men, but of al Tirantes and Prynces was the moſt gently and mercifull?

                  <p>Why doeſt thou tremble in ſafetie, and ſtumble in the playne, and ſtay vpon the ſide of a ſheluing downefall? I wyl not here bryng into thy remembrance what the Philoſophers do diſpute in this poynt. For there be many thynges which the troubleſomneſſe of hym that lyeth a dying, and the ſhortneſſe of the tyme wyl not ſuffer to be done, and therefore it ought deepely to be engraffed and rooted in thy mynde whatſoeuer the auncient Philoſophers haue diſputed concernyng this matter. For as they hold opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, rare proſperitie ſpecially towardes a mans ende, is able to make al remedies agaynſt aduerſitie and hard fortune, voyde &amp; to no purpoſe: but as touchyng thoſe thynges whiche are alleaged agaynſt death, they be alwayes profitable and neceſſarie, whiche no caſual but the natural and inuincible neceſſitie of dying maketh
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:14998:333"/>to ſtande in ful force and effect. Among diuers other, truely <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> gathereth together many ſounde reaſons and perſwaſions, in the fyrſt dayes diſputation of his <hi>Tuſculan</hi> queſtions, whereof I made mention a litle before: whiche vnleſſe thou haſt alreadie learned in times paſt, I haue no leaſure now to teach thee, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he concludeth, that whether he that dieth, ſeeme to be in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie or aduerſitie: neuertheleſſe, foraſmuche as generally the whole ſtate of mankynde is equally ſubiect to the dartes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultes of Fortune, it is to be ſuppoſed, that by death he is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuered from good thynges, whiche doubtleſſe he ſhall fynde to be true, whoſoeuer ſhall geue hym ſelfe to the deepe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of worldly affayres. Wherefore, by death he findeth him ſelfe aduauntaged and not hyndered, and thynking continually there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when it commeth he maketh account thereof, as of the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger and ſeruant of his delyuerer: and when he is once paſt it, and looketh backe vpon it, he beholdeth, as it were out of a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe, how he hath eſcaped the deceites of the worlde, and the priſon of this fleſhe. The very ſame ſenſe doth <hi>Cicero</hi> followe in his diſputation, that whether the ſoule dye with the body, or be tranſlated to ſome other habitation, that either there is no euyll at al, or very much good in death. Sharply truely among his owne Countreifolke at that time, but among your Philoſophers now adayes, yea and your common people, a thing nothing doubted of: and truly I beleeue, neither vnperſwaded vnto <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelfe, of whom we haue ſo much ſpoken: which opinion moſt frankly he hath declared in many and ſundry places, although he applied him ſelfe vnto the want of fayth in him, with whom he communed, or the diſtruſtineſſe of the time in which he liued. But in few wordes, thus perſwade thy ſelfe, that thy ſoule is immortal, which not only the whole conſent of your na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ion, but alſo the moſt excellent of al the Philoſophers do, &amp; haue defended. Repoſe no truſt in the death of the ſoule, whoſe nature is ſuch, that it cannot die, and thinke not that there remaineth no euyl after death, becauſe there ſhalbe no ſoule to ſuffer it. But foraſmuch as the creatour of the ſoule is gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and louing, and merciful, he wyl not deſpiſe the woorke of his owne handes, but wyl be neere vnto them that cal vpon him faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. Vnto hym let your prayers, vnto hym let your vowes be
<pb facs="tcp:14998:334"/>directed: let the vttermoſt of your hope depend vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, &amp; let your laſt gaſpe ende, in callyng vpon his name. Depart quickly, feare nothing, dame Nature that is the moſt louing mother of al other mothers, hath made no horrible thing, it is the errour of men, and not the nature of the thing, that ought to be prouided for, that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth death to ſeeme dreadful. If thou harbour any great attempt in thine hart, or go about any excellent &amp; high matter, deſpiſe the baſe and low ſpeeches &amp; deedes of the raſkal multitude, but haue them in admiration, whom to imitate is the perfect path vnto true glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Among our Countreymen truly, of ſuch as haue dyed merely and happily, there are innumerable examples. But yf we ſearche rather after ſuch as are of more antiquitie, we ſhal finde many that haue not onely taken their death valiantly, but alſo haſtened it: which deede in <hi>Marcus Cato, Marcus Cicero</hi> blameth, &amp; <hi>Seneca</hi> commendeth, as we ſayd erewhile. As for you, ye lyke wel of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but woorſt of the ſeconde, for that it is more tollerable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe an errour, then to commende it. But I reiecte them both, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as for to anſwere when a man is called, &amp; to obey with reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, is prayſe woorthie: euen ſo, without licence of the General, to depart from the watch &amp; keeping of the body, is to be counted hygh treaſon, &amp; woorthie to be puniſhed, eyther with cruel baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or with extreame torment.

If thou neglect this houre, when it is once paſt it wyll neuer returne agayne. Whith qualitie, although it be common to all houres, that alwayes they paſſe away and neuer returne, yet many tymes that which hath been omitted in one houre, may be perhappes recouered in another: but yet the neglectyng of the laſt houre of a mans lyfe
<pb facs="tcp:14998:345"/>is irrecurable. And therefore, as ſome report it to be found in the ſecret diſputations of the ſoule, the errours of this lyfe, are as it were ſofte falles vpon the playne grounde, after which, a man may ſoone ryſe vp agayne: but the ſinne vnto death, is compared vnto a greeuous fall from ſome hygh and craggie place, after which, it is not poſſible to aryſe any more, the hurt therein taken is ſo great, that it can not be ſalued. Wherefore, helpe thy ſelfe nowe whyle thou mayeſt, and call to remembraunce, not onely what your owne writers ſay, but alſo what <hi>Cicero</hi> counſelleth, who in his woorke <hi>de Diuina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione,</hi> of Diuination, diſputing of thoſe that are dying: <hi>Doo thou cheefely,</hi> quod he, <hi>ſtudie to winne commendation, and thynke that they which haue lyued otherwyſe then they ought, doo moſt bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repent them of their ſinnes.</hi> What, I pray thee, coulde be vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by any man more religiouſly or profitably, yf ſo be that be followed which is commaunded, and thou repent thee, though it be late fyrſt? A difficult and dangerous matter it is truely to deferre the tyme, which hath deceyued very many, who wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly and willingly put of the clenſing of their ſoules, which can not be doone too ſpeedily, from day to day, and alwayes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourne it vnto their latter tyme, in which beyng ſuddenly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſhort, and amazed with the neereneſſe of death, they leaue all vndoone whatſoeuer they determined. Concernyng which matter, foraſmuche as your writers haue ſayde very muche, it ſhall not be impertinent to heare what the Poet <hi>Virgil</hi> ſayeth, who is an externall witneſſe, with what woordes he reprooueth this ſlouthfulneſſe and negligence in repentance, which to come foorth of his mouth is woonderfull, whereas among the infernal Spirites he bryngeth in hym to be a Iudge, whoſe vpryghtneſſe and equitie is verie famous. <hi>Who,</hi> as he ſayeth, <hi>Examineth the Ghoſtes, and puniſheth them, and conſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them to confeſſe their deceiptes: and alſo if there be any ſuch, that whyle they lyued vpon the earth, reioyced in vaine thefte, &amp; dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to repent them thereof vntil they dyed, which was too late.</hi> And albeit this be ſo dangerous as I haue declared, notwithſtanding there is nothing more perilous then Deſpaire, neither hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of your ſaluation founde out any thing more hurtfull to your
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:14998:345"/>good eſtate. For al other miſcheefes are aſſwaged by their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar remedies, but of al eulles this is the greateſt and laſt of all, whiche yf it take holde of the ſoule when it is departyng, then is there no place left for recouerie. The ſame therefore alwayes, but ſpecially in the ende, ought moſt earneſtly be reſiſted, for that then it vſeth to vrge moſt ſharpely. And nowe there is no tyme left for thee, wherein by ſtaggeryng or trifling thou reiect whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome counſel concernyng thy ſaluation. From this let no feare dryue thee, nor the ſhame and ſorowe of differringe withholde thee: it is better to awake late at nyght, then not at al, and what ſoeuer is ill differed, is woorſe omitted.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:14998:353"/>leſſe, that all manner of buriall was deuiſed not ſo muche for the dead ſake, as for the lyuing. Which to be true, the outward ſhewe and repreſentation of Tumbes &amp; graues doth euidently declare, whiche within ſide beyng euyl fauoured and horrible, do encloſe their tenaunt within rough and rude rubbiſh, but on the outſide are wrought with great cunning and coſt, where the workemen for the moſt part decke them foorth to the viewe with carued pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of marble, and ſtatues of golde, and armes beawtifully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>painted.</p>

                  <p>Yea, <hi>Pompeius</hi> the great as woorthie a perſonage as he was, lay vnburied: or rather lay not ſtil, but was ouerwhelmed &amp; toſſed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſurging waues. Neyther do I thinke thee to be ſo mad or foolyſh, that in thine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion he ſhould haue been made the more happie if he had been buried: as his companion <hi>Marcus Craſſus</hi> was neuer awhit the more vnfortunate, in that there was none preſent to cauſe hym to be enterred. In al other thinges they were almoſt equal, ſauing that <hi>Craſſus</hi> head, as it was moſt meete for hym y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was of al men the moſt rych &amp; couetous, beyng more heauie then gold, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, but neuertheleſſe both of them to be contemned &amp; reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully dealt withal. Vnleſſe perhaps their third fellowe be more happie, for that he was ſet vp to be ſeene vpon the heade of a moſt loftie and bewtifull <hi>Coloſſus,</hi> ouerlookyng there the toppes of the higheſt churches and ſteeples: whom perhaps I may confeſſe to haue been in warre more fortunate, but in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall I muſt needes denye it. So that I may ſay, that the ſame ſtone is bewtified by hym, but made nothyng the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier. For what happineſſe can this be in hym that hath no feelyng, or as a man woulde ſay, in one ſtone not couered with another?

                  <p>Both <hi>Paulus Aemilius,</hi> and <hi>Claudius Marcellus</hi> had
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:14998:353"/>lyen vnburied, had not their moſt deadly enimie dained them of a graue, the rather, as I ſuppoſe, in admiration of their vertue, &amp; in reſpect of his owne honeſtie, then mooued with any remorſe of duetie or conſcience, wherof there reſted no one iote within that mans hart. In ſomuche, that I thinke they hated their graues when they were enterred, &amp; yf they might haue had their libertie, would rather haue choſen to haue lyen vnburyed. <hi>Cyrus</hi> alſo that was kyng of <hi>Perſia</hi> lay vnburied, &amp; neither that, nor yet his <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> bottle were any reproch vnto hym at all, but rather their cruel and ſauage manners, by meanes of which he ſuſteyned that moſt foule ignominie, &amp; ſhameful iniurie. But why do I now ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther togeather ſo many ſeueral naked corpſes, with <hi>Romane</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, and forreine kinges, that were bereaued not onely of the laſt and wiſhed ſolemnitie of their graues, but alſo of the vayne honour belonging thereunto: &amp; farther, which more is, that were torne &amp; plucked in peeces, &amp; throwen about in mammockes, that a man woulde iudge it an enuious matter to haue lyen with an whole carcas: ſeeing that there are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſant in our mindes &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories the miſerable maſſacres of whole nations dead, and as a man may ſay, the whole worlde vnburyed? For why, with kyng <hi>Cyrus</hi> of whom I ſpake erewhile, there were two hundred thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <hi>Perſians</hi> ſlayne: and alſo with <hi>Craſſus,</hi> ſixteene moſt valiant &amp; flouriſhing legions: &amp; at the ouerthrowe at <hi>Cannas,</hi> aboue foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore &amp; fiue thouſand citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> &amp; their confederates: and ſixe &amp; fiftie thouſand <hi>Carthagiens, Spaniardes, Ligurians,</hi> and <hi>Frenchmen</hi> at the ryuer <hi>Metaurus,</hi> togeather with their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne: and againe at <hi>Aquas Sextias,</hi> which is the proper name of the place, two hundred thouſand <hi>Germanes</hi> not farre from the <hi>Alpes, Marius</hi> beyng General in both places, which were but an hundred &amp; fiftie thouſand as ſome wryters do report, but they that ſay leaſt of al, not aboue threeſcore thouſand <hi>Cimbrians,</hi> whiche lay there vnburied. Moreouer, at <hi>Philippi</hi> the aides of al confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate kinges &amp; nations, and the floure and ſtrength of the <hi>Italian</hi> youth, as it pleaſed the maieſtie of the goddes ſo to deale, wanting the honour of burial, made fat the <hi>Aemonian</hi> fieldes, &amp; filled the paunches of the wylde beaſtes and carren crowes.

And (that I may not euermore dwel in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the <hi>Italian</hi> toyles and miſeries) when the whole <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> power by ſea was drowned before the citie of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> what graue or burial had they? I paſſeouer in ſilence <hi>Salamina</hi> and <hi>Marathon,</hi> with three hundred thouſand <hi>Perſians</hi> whith many.

I ſpeake nothyng of al ſuch kindes of plagues, whereby it is a woful caſe to here, how many woorthie &amp; deerelie beloued carcaſes haue been moſt pitifully defiled, ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and made away.

Nor of tempeſtes, and dayly ſhypwrackes: for as for thoſe that peryſhe by fire, there is no man wyl ſay that they neede any graue. I omit ciuil furies and outrages, and domeſtical broyles and contentions, of whiche it is ſayde: <hi>That cyuile warre can ſcarſe graunt a graue to the captaynes:</hi> whiche may be muche more truely veryfied of forreine battayles.

Which being in old tyme, as alſo of late dayes an ordinarie miſchiefe in diuerſe places, yet neuer raged any where more notoriouſly then in <hi>Aſia,</hi> whereas it is reported, that there were twelue cities by horrible gapynges of the earth deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in one day.
